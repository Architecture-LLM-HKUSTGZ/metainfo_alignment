For the drilling works, trial pit, GS, UT construction works, the area will be fenced off by water-filled barriers (without panel) before commencing any works to prevent any impact to track operation (All trial pit, GS & UT to be excavated by hand dig method).\n2. All site staff should wear the required PPE such as safety helmet, reflective vest, and safety boots.\n3. CP(T) shall be appointed to escort all transportation inside the SHD.\n4. CP(T) shall be appointed to provide pre-work safety briefing at the worksite and WPIC to brief the works for all workers at the worksite before commencing the works.\n5. CP(T) needs to provide works Notice to Depot and obtain approval in advance. The report duty to Depot before works.\n6. For those who carried out works within OAs, should have railway qualification of RSI and be supervised by CP(T).\n7. Demarcate and barricade the operation zone with standard track side works plastic red banner fixed at the reflective cones at both ends and in between work and the barricaded area.\n8. For works within track, authority shall be sought prior to commencement of any operation.\n9. CP(T) shall coordinate with DYM when using west level crossing to the works areas.\n10. CP(T) shall be responsible for measuring the height of the vehicle to ensure the height of vehicles with materials/ plants is within 4m height restriction before allowing vehicles to use west level crossing.\n11. Large plants transportation shall be carried out in NTH.\n12. If the GS/ UT construction works cannot be done in one day, temporary backfill with sandbag, water-filled barrier (without panel)/ fencing for physical separation and additional warning lights are required where necessary.\n13. Fuel filling services for drilling rig should be carried out at night time. To minimize the risk, keep the volume of the fuel tank enough for the next day’s work only. Adequate firefighting tools/materials will be provided on Site. No fuel shall be left within Mainline (OA) when not attended.\n14. Keep the works area tidy daily.\n15. CP(T) ensure no materials/ waste left in the OAs.\n16. Inform DYM before leaving daily.\n17. Apart from CP, WPIC will be assigned for the installation works.\n\nReference shall be made to the Traffic and Security Management Plan, which includes the arrangement of CP(T)’s within the OA, which has been submitted separately.\n\n### Access Route\nPlant and material delivery to the site shall be via the west gate and west level crossing in the initial stage when the vehicular bridge is not ready. Vehicles will be escorted by escort car with CP(T) after entering the depot, or from the East gate when the vehicular bridge is open for use. (Details please refer to submission “Traffic Management Plan\")\n\n### ETMS (Engineering Works & Traffic Information Management System)\nWhen Work Area within Depot and Mainline, CSHK would submit the NTH/NPH (SPA/PA) and AP(E) application with programme to MTR via ETMS accordingly.\n\n### Test Track Crossing Arrangement\nWhile the proposed gates 6, 7, and A are not ready, we will use the existing gates EAG 4, 5 & 50.84U MAG to access the works area for carrying out the monitoring marker installation and preparation.\n\nFor Test Track and Bifurcation Area (area between Test Track and Mainline), the access shall be via existing gates no. EAG 4 & 5, and liaise with Depot Control and TC.\n\nFor Mainline, the access should be used 50.84U MAG and liaise with OCC and TC.\n\nThe proposed gate no. 6, 7, and A crossing arrangements are as follows:\n1. CP(T) should stand by at each Proposed Access Gate to manage the access control, operate the gate manually and keep the corresponding Gate Key.\n2. There are 3 pairs of Gates with 6 CP(T) provided at: CP(T) — 1 at Gate 6A; CP(T) — 2 at Gate 7A; CP(T) — 3 at Gate AA; CP(T) — 4 at Gate 6B; CP(T) — 5 at Gate 7B; CP(T) - 6 at Gate AB;\n3. CP(T) — 1 should report to the DYM before commencement of works and he/she is the single point of contact with DYM/ EPIC. He/she should also communicate with CP(T) —2, CP(T)-3, CP(T)-4, CP(T) — 5, and CP(T) — 6 and ensure that the open/close of all access gates are synchronized.\n4. Each group will be CP(T), WPIC, 3 to 4 nos of workers.\n5. Physical barriers (water-filled barriers without panel) will be used for demarcating the works area to ensure CSHK workers will not be able to go from the work site on/near the test track into the mainline area (Permissions from MTR OCC TC are required via DCC prior to the commencement of the work on/near the test track).\n\n### Transportation Arrangement\nFor standpipe, piezometer located in the operations area (OAs) between test track and mainline, drilling rigs are required. There are a few delivery methods as follows:\n\n#### Lifting Operation at South Road (Method 1)\n50 Ton mobile crane would be adopted to transplant the drilling rig to the work area. The actual size may vary slightly to suit the available arranged plant. Also, the lifting operation will be submitted to MTR for approval before starting. The lifting operation included ground condition checking, lifting plan with calculation. The typical lifting plan, section plan, and calculation are as follows:\n\n- The 50 Ton mobile crane will set up at the South Road at Night Time. The ground conditions shall be checked by ICE for the 50 Ton mobile crane lifting operation and submit to MTR.\n- Lifting Weight Calculation, check the lifting object weight included LAGA weights, ensure the weight not more than 80% Capacity of Mobile Crane.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Drilling rig weight = 1.4 tons\n- Crane lorry lifting capacity = 13.4 tons @ 14.6m\n- 80% of Capacity = 10.72 tons\n\n#### Contingency Plan\nEmergency team and a spare lifting crane will be on standby in the event of lifting crane failure or breakdown.\n\n#### Rigging Point of Drilling Rig\n- Except for the drilling rig, the water tank (empty) and casing (maximum 6m length) with hanger would be delivered to the works area by mobile crane. The valid LALG certificates would be provided.\n\n#### Limitation of the Mobile Crane\n- Inclined Angle\n- Boom Length\n- Swing Angle\n- Loading Radius\n\n#### Drilling Rig Installation\n- Procedure for Raising of Rig Mast\n  - Once the drill is in place, the operator will perform the inspection with the checklist \"Drill Weekly Checklist.\"\n  - The hydraulic mast cylinder must be completely depressurized, confirmed by the position of the mast raise/lower lever and visual inspection by the operator. The two backstay legs should be fixed in the designed position of the drilling rig.\n  - Others standing near the drilling rig during mast raising operation should not be allowed. The operator raises the mast slowly by increasing the pressure of the mast hydraulic cylinder and monitors two backstay legs remain fixed in the right position.\n  - Once the mast is in the designed position, the operator should hold the pressure of the mast hydraulic cylinder to secure and lock the mast in place and instruct the assistant to insert the safety pin to lock the position of the mast. Then, tighten the two backstay leg bolts. After the operator checks and confirms the mast position, he will release the mast hydraulic lifting cylinder pressure and the mast lifting procedure is basically completed.\n  - Drilling works may proceed after general condition checking.\n\n- Procedure for Lowering of Rig Mast\n  - The operator should hold the mast in position by increasing the pressure of the hydraulic cylinder slowly so that there is no tension on the mast backstay legs. The operator shall then instruct the assistant to loosen the bolts of the two mast backstay legs.\n  - Remove the safety pin after the bolts of the mast backstay legs.\n  - The monitoring mast legs should be placed at the designed position. After visual inspection by the operator, the rig mast can resume mast lowering operations until it is in a horizontal position.\n\n#### Lifting Method for the Loose Materials\n- Double tagline attached at the lifting objects before lifting.\n- For rigging stabilization, the tiedown straps will be used to tie the drill casings with hanger together; connect the hook with anchoring point is secured (the anchoring point must be structurally sound tested and examined by a competent examiner).\n- Prevent slipping or displacement of any loose objects or loads during lifting. Double wrap choker hitch method will be adopted.\n- Track trolleys are to be used for the transportation of dismantled drilling rig parts near the existing building AB23. The transportation and set-up of the drill rig are as follows:\n  - One bay of wire mesh fence will be fenced off by a water barrier near AB23 and then temporarily removed to form the temporary access to Test Track.\n  - The track trolleys will then be loaded on Test Track.\n  - The parts of the drilling rig will be loaded on the track trolleys and transported to the required location between Test Track and mainline.\n  - The wire mesh will be reinstalled after the transportation of parts each day.\n  - The drilling rig will be assembled on site and certified by RPE. After that, the drilling rig is ready to work.\n  - The temporary access and routing of track trolley refer to Appendix Track Trolley.\n\n#### Manual Handling (Method 3)\n- For easy manual handling, the drilling rig will be dismantled into small parts (drilling rigs, water tank (empty), and casing with hanger), and materials/ casing will be divided into small sizes. The small parts of the drilling rig will be transported to the bifurcation area via the existing gate no. 4 & 5. The drilling rig will be assembled on site and certified by RPE. After that, the drilling rig is ready to work.\n- The largest part weight of the drilling rigs should be ~200kg, and min. 6 nos. of workers to carry.\n\n## 8. **Safety**\n\n## 9. **Environmental**\n\n## 10. **Quality Control**\n\n## 11. **Appendices**\n\nThis document is controlled in soft copy.

A plant permit system and permit to lift will be adopted to ensure the condition of the lifting crane and lifting equipment are checked before use. To meet the programme requirement, 6 work fronts will be mobilised for OYB North. The major plant and equipment that will be deployed to carry out the works are as follows:\n\n### Northern work area at SHD Depot at W2\n\n| Plant / Equipment | Quantity |\n|-------------------|----------|\n| Backhoe (Northern work area at SHD Depot) | 6 |\n| Mobile Crane (Northern work area at SHD Depot) | 6 |\n| Cherry Picker | 6 |\n| Compactor | 6 |\n\n### Manpower\n\n| Manpower | Quantity |\n|----------|----------|\n| General Labour | 40 |\n| Driver | 6 |\n| Rigger | 12 |\n| Operator | 6 |\n\nLifting Arrangement: No part of the mobile crane/crane lorry will work beyond the water filled barrier and the maximum lifting load shall be <80% of the SWL. The weight of the lifting gear must be included as part of the lifting load. For any lifting operation, the mobile crane / crane lorry outriggers must be fully extended and the unsafe zone fenced off. For details of the lifting work over the test track, please refer to Section 8.5 and the general lifting method statement will be submitted separately.\n\n## 7. **Traffic and Security Management**\n\n### Contractor Vehicle Arrangement\n\nAccess to the site shall be as follows:\n\n- **Access to W2: Up to May 2024**, access to the site will be via the west gate and west level crossing as shown in Figure 7.1.\n- **From June 2024**, access to W2 will be from the east gate and the steel vehicle bridge as shown in Figure 7.2.\n\n#### Procedure to access the site from West gate and West level crossing:\n\n- Pre-registration of the vehicle number plate and driver information will be provided to the Security Operation Centre (SOC) to obtain the entry permit through the west gate.\n- Contractor Vehicle shall display the entry permit, a label with the wordings '1701 contractor vehicle' and location plan, and the destination on the windscreen.\n- CSHK will report the total number of workers 'In/Out' Records to SOC Daily.\n- Pre-registered vehicles shall not carry unauthorized/unregistered passengers.\n\n## 8. **Construction Methods / Construction Sequence**\n\nIn general, this method statement covers: i) site clearance, ground levelling and building of the temporary platform for the RP fence installation, ii) RP fence installation.\n\nPrior to start the site work, the CCTV and C-smart facilities will be installed on site, the MS for CCTV and C-smart Installation will be submitted in the separate submission.\n\n### 8.1 Site clearance, ground levelling and building the temporary platform for fence installation\n\n#### Workfront in W2\n\nPrior to the RP fencing installation, site clearance and ground levelling will be carried to remove vegetation, abandoned cable troughs, remove the cable manhole, track signage and to level up the ground condition.\n\nWe will use the hand tools to remove the vegetation. For removing the cable troughs and manhole we will erect shed net to fence off the drilling area, use the electric portable drill to break the concrete and then remove the broken concrete at the same shift. Handheld grinder will be used for existing equipment removal including the existing signage, existing gate relocation, and existing RP Fencing. The hot-work permit will be executed. The fire servers and equipment and fire marshal will be provided.\n\nTo meet the programme requirement, it is planned to have 6 work fronts at peak as shown in Figure 8.1-1 below.\n\n- Between GLA1 to GL45; generally flat ground area\n- Between GL45 to GL58; from test track 5m is flat ground, then slope area.\n- Between GL58 to GL77; from test track 3m is flat ground, then rock slope area.\n- Between GL77 to GL100; from test track 6m is flat ground, then slope area.\n- Between GL100 to GL120; all area is flat area.\n\nAs the working area is 10.7m wide, including 2.7m width for the RP footing and sheet/PBSH pile installation, a temporary platform is required to be constructed to provide a level surface to carry out the works.\n\n#### At locations with flat ground\n\nReferring to the existing site condition, from GL 1A to GL 45, granular sub-base will be used to fill and level up the existing ground condition and shall be well compacted. The ground surface will be compacted by the vibratory roller with repeated passes, the actual passes subject to the weight of roller and thickness of subbase. The maximum depth of the filling materials is 150mm.\n\n**Step 1- Install barrier**\n\nWaterfilled barriers will be installed along the test track (2.8m distance from the centre of track) with orange net securely fixed to the existing cable brackets along the mainline side in order to confine the workfront as shown in Figure 8.1-3. After enclosing the works area with water filled barriers and orange net, the workfront area will be declared as a CA Area. Subsequent work can then be carried out during TH, except for passing or lifting over the test track which can only be undertaken during NPH.\n\n**Step 2-Remove Vegetation**\n\nA 3 or 5-ton excavator, to suit availability, will be delivered to the works areas via the access gates and across the test track. To allow the excavator to cross the test track a prefabricated temporary platform will be built to deck over the track when the temporary level crossings are not available. The temporary platform will be removed after the excavator has crossed over the test track. The platform (Figure 8.1-4) will be installed and removed during the same shift and will be designed to allow for lightweight components that can be installed using either the 3 or 5 ton excavator or a mobile crane located on the South Road. Site clearance and ground levelling will be carried out with the assistance of the excavator. In general, granular sub-base will be used for ground levelling. The sub-base, if required, will be delivered to the works area by 5.5 ton dump trucks via the level crossing or steel platform (if the level crossing has not been installed).\n\nThe existing RP fence will be temporarily removed locally to allow the excavator to cross the test track and reinstated immediately after the works. The connection details to allow temporary removal of the existing RP fence are shown in Figure 8.1-5, the location for temporary removal of existing fence are shown in Appendix C.\n\nGarbage removal or material delivery will be by manual delivery or rail mounted wagon/engineering train (subject to advance booking and availability) at the initial stage when the BUGN for material lifting over the test track is pending approval. For the manual removal and delivery, access to the works areas will be via the existing emergency gates 4 (EAG4) & 5 (EAG5) during NPH/TH.\n\n#### At locations with sloping ground - Form the working platform for RP Fence and piling works at TH/NPH\n\nFrom GL 45 to GL 100 the mainline and test track are at different levels and are separated by an existing slope. A working platform shall be formed to provide a level surface for RP fence installation and piling works. The platform will be formed by concrete blocks and filled with compacted granular fill or light weight concrete. The design of the working platform will be submitted separately. The construction sequence is shown below in Figure 8.1.6 with detailed sections at GL20,40,60,80,100 shown in Figure 8.1-7 to 8.1-11.\n\nAfter completion, the platform shall be checked by the TWC and a Permit to Load issued before use.\n\n**Step 1:** lifting the concrete block to the work area  \n**Step 2:** use the steel tie interlock the concrete block  \n**Step 3:** Lifting the subbase by skip to the work area  \n**Step 4:** Lay and compact the subbase  \n**Step 5:** Repeat lift the concrete block  \n**Step 6:** Lay and compact the final level  \n\nThe working platform will be constructed from gates TT06 and TT07 from GL 45 to GL 100. The level crossings will be used for material delivery (such as concrete block, backfilled material etc) in order to minimise the lifting method (or waiting for BUGN approval) over test track.\n\n### 8.2 Install the earthing system at ground level during TH\n\nAfter forming the temporary platform and compacting the sub-base, the electrode rod and earthing pit will be installed below the ground level at a maximum spacing of 20m along the proposed RP Fence, as shown in Figure 8.2-1. The post hole borer will be used to make a ~3m depth of hole for the earthing installation as shown in Figure 8.2-2. The layout plan is shown in the RP Fence layout in Appendix C.\n\n### 8.3 RP fencing installation\n\nUpon completion of the site clearance and working platform, the RP fence installation will commence. The early stages of RP fence installation (Jun 2024 to Dec 2025) will be divided into two stages. The details of the RP fence setting out are shown Appendix C. The sequence of work will be as follows:\n\n#### Stage 1 of RP Fence\n\nFencing installation will start from GL 20 to GL 120 from June 2024 to Sept 2024 (when the west test track is still in use) and existing gates 4 (EAG4) & 5 (EAG5) will be maintained. Workers will access the works areas via the test track during NPH subject to depot approval. From GL 1A to GL 20, the clearance between the OHL masts of the test track and mainline is constrained such that the potential risk of OHL wire damage or contact during lifting is considered too high. It is proposed to install the RP fence at this location adjacent to the mainline after the west test track closure August 2024. The Stage 1 Layout Plan shown in Figure 8.3-1 refers.\n\n## 9. **Safety**\n\n## 10. **Environmental**\n\n## 11. **Quality Control**\n\n## 12. **Appendices**\n\nThis document is controlled in soft copy.\n\nAny hard copies seen are uncontrolled unless Page 2 of 37\n\nchopped with a red control stamp\n## 9. **Safety**\n\nSafety is paramount in all construction activities, especially when working in close proximity to operational railway lines.

Installation of I&M (Baseline reading obtained & agreed)\n2. RP Fencing erection\n3. Predrilling\n4. Construction of level crossing/backfilling\n5. Precautionary sheet pile installation at W1 & W2\n\nThe above works activity shall refer to separate Method Statement.\n\n### 7.2 Logistics Arrangement for W2\n\n#### 7.2.1 Logistics Arrangement: Labour Access\n\nRSI training is required for workers working in W2 area which lies in close proximity to the test track and Mainline. During boarding of the shuttle bus, hand-held facial recognition will be performed to verify the worker's qualification. The facial recognition system will check if the person has passed the RSI and possesses a green card. A list of workers will be submitted to MTR for registration before starting of the works, the list shall be updated weekly and available for MTR as requested. Workers will be picked up at a designated area such as Tung Chung/Mei Foo Station. They will be transferred through the West Gate or East Gate and taken to the Welfare facility at WX or W1 where they can change into working uniform. From here, the workers will be transported by another shuttle bus (escorted by CP on the shuttle bus) to the designated gate area. A label on the helmet will also help distinguish which workers have attended the RSI training.\n\n#### 7.2.2 General logistics arrangement: Material and Plant delivery\n\nHeight checking vehicle before entering East/West gate\n\nBefore entering the west gate/east gate, CP(T) will measure the height of vehicle to ensure the height is within 4m. After entering the east/west gate, the Contractor Vehicle will be accompanied by the escort vehicle with CP(T).\n\nA Permit-to-Move is required for vehicles over 4m high and below 4.5m high. Vehicle height measurements/ checks for approval by CWBU to DCC shall be conducted by CP(T)s before entering the depot areas and passing through the west level crossing. When accessing the west level crossing, an escort car with a CP(T) shall communicate with DCC in order to get permission to drive across the level crossing. CP(T) shall inform DYM when the vehicles are passing through the yellow line underneath the height restriction gauge and within the double white zone. No vehicle Reversing is allowed.\n\n##### 7.2.2.1 Logistics Arrangement from GL A1 – GL 40\n\nWe will primarily use the East Gate for the Works at GL A1-40. At this area the test track is to be removed from GL A1 - GL40. The ground level is relatively flat and does not require backfilling. After removal of the test track and OHL mast, construction vehicles with height limited to 4m will be able to access in and out of this area without a level crossing and lifting over the test track is not required for delivering plant and materials.\n\n##### 7.2.2.2 Logistics Arrangement from GL 40 – GL 100\n\nWe will primarily use the East Gate and level crossing at Gate 06 and Gate A for the Works at GL 40-100. At this area the test track is to be maintained. Backfill along the existing slope is required for the erection of RP fencing. Details of the backfilling and erection of the RP fencing shall refer to the separate method statement of RP fencing. After backfilling, the rigs would be able to access from the lower side of Gate 06 and Gate A as shown below.\n\nThe piling rigs need to cross the level crossing to access the working location. The travelling height of a rig is around 3.80m, which is lower than the max height allowed at the level crossing, and its width is 2.26m. During working condition, the rig will be positioned parallel with the test track, reducing the risk and hazard of damaging the cables. The working height of the rigs will be 9m in total reduced from 13.61m to suit the overall height of the Railway Protection fencing.\n\nDue to the restricted work area, lifting over the test track is required for delivery of construction equipment and materials. This will be subject to a separate approved EDOC and BUGN being issued by MTR prior to commencing any lifting works.\n\nA temporary steel cover will be installed between GL 40 and GL100, (Detail refer to separate MS and EDOC) details of which will be provided under a separate Method Statement and detailed design submission. After installation of the steel cover, construction material can be lifted across the text track during day time and not limited to NTH only. This would greatly facilitate material delivery and the frequency of using NTH can be greatly reduced.\n\nThe casings will be properly stored on site at W2 and secured by using a U-shaped steel clamp fixed to each end of the casings on the bottom row as shown below. Steel wedges would be placed under the bottom of the outer bottom row casings to prevent movement or toppling. The H beams will be stacked in a horizontal position to prevent toppling as shown below (max. height 1.7m/ 9 number that can be stacked). No more than 2 batches of casing/H-pile shall be stored in the bifurcation per work front. The casing length will be limited to 6m in order not to exceed the overall height of the fencing during lifting. A lifting Clamp will be used for rigging the H beam/casing during unloading and loading.\n\n### 7.2.3 Logistics Arrangement: Grouting\n\nWe propose to use on site mixing for the pile grouting due to the restricted space available at W2, the grouting station will be located at W11. There will be several grouting stations located at W11 with multiple storing tanks. Cement at the storing tanks/silo will be replenished by using a cement tanker truck through the hose from the refill truck. The grout station will be properly covered. There will be a separate grout pump connected to the grouting station to deliver the mixed grout. The grout pipe will be connected from the grout pump through the buried pipe under the test track and to the designated pile at W2 (Detail refer to separate MS and EDOC). The station will be delivered by flat lorry via the vehicular steel bridge and unloaded at W11. The detail of the pumping station shall refer to Appendix E.\n\n## 7.3 Construction Method/Sequence for W1\n\n### 7.3.1 Logistics Arrangement: Labour & Plant Access through TTA Gate 3\n\nOn the South Side, there is an existing access gate (TTA Gate 3) from the slip road from the Tai Ho Interchange. An additional access gate (TTA Gate 3A) is proposed to be installed at the eastern end of Shun Long Slip Road for access and egress to the OHL portal and OYB -South construction areas.\n\nA grouting station will be set up under Shun Long Road near the existing abutment. Cement deliveries will be via TTA Gate 3.\n\n## 7.4 Method & Sequence of Drilling\n\n### 7.4.1 Setting Out\n\nSurveyors will set out the levels, position and alignment of all piles. Permits-to-Excavate will be issued and briefed to the associated site personnel by the CP and WPIC prior to any drilling works. The setting out will be checked by joint survey with MTR’s survey team.\n\n### 7.4.2 Drilling with Casing (Permanent)\n\nFor each pile, position the drill rig at the setting out location. Lift the 6m steel casing by mobile crane to the drill rig and fix the steel casing with the drill rig's hydraulic retaining clamp. Once secured, lift the drill bit and insert it into the steel casing. Fix the drill bit with the drill rig's rotator and fix the ring bit to the drill bit and release the hydraulic retaining clamp. Check the verticality with the use of a spirit level in two perpendicular directions and adjust until vertical. Once complete and checked drilling may commence.\n\nEach pile is drilled concurrently with the casing installation by using the ring bit method until the blockhead is reached. The verticality of the pile will be checked again once the first section of steel casing has been installed. Refer to Table 19.1 of the M&W Specification for the verticality tolerance. In accordance with the Project Specification, piles within 10m cannot be installed concurrently.\n\nThe RP fence structure is required to have sufficient clearance to the structural gauge which is a minimum of 2615 mm measured, from rail centreline, for the depot track and it is 2995 mm for the mainline. Refer to the RP fence method statement, submitted separately, for details.\n\nMinimum Working Space for Socket H Pile along Track:\n\n=1.35m (width of RP fence footing) + 0.5m (clearance) +1.7m (half width of piling rig)\n\nIf a pile is found to be out of tolerance, the casing will be extracted and re-drilled to the required position. If a pile is found within tolerance, the drilling will continue until reaching the required level. After reaching the required level, retract the drill rods and cover the top of the casing to prevent any object / body falling into the hole.\n\nThe drill bit shall not advance independently of the casing. During installation of the permanent casing, the drilling bit must be interlocked with the casing by the pilot bit and casing shoe as shown in the attached catalogue in Appendix D. Each segment of the steel casing are joined by butt-welding to form a continuous casing. During welding, a spirit level will be used to ensure the straightness of the joint between the 2 steel sections.\n\nUpon the completion of permanent the casing installation, the volume of excavated material will be compared to the theoretical quantity to determine the extent of over break (if any). A procedure shall be carried out to monitor the condition of over-break that the volume of drilled out soil will be measured and compared with the theoretical volume.\n\n### 7.4.3 Rocket Socket Drilling\n\nAfter completing the permanent left-in casing drilling to the required level, the \"Down the Hole\" method will be used to drill the specified 550mm diameter rock socket into grade III bedrock or better. The minimum length of rock socket shall be in accordance with the Contract drawings. The Engineer's Representative shall be informed to witness once the rockhead level has been reached. Rock samples shall be collected for inspection by the Engineer's representative.\n\n### 7.4.4 Installation of Steel H Pile\n\nAfter cleaning of the pile and prior to installation of the steel section, the MTR inspection team will be invited to check and verify the depth. 12m Steel H-pile sections (305x305x223 kg/m UBP) prefabricated will be lifted by mobile crane into the installed steel casing. The final length of the H-pile sections to be installed will be agreed with RP depending on the proximity of the pile to the nearest running rail. Temporary positioning plates shall be welding to the side of the H-pile prior to installation to support the pile once installed and allow welding of the subsequent H-pile section. The positioning plates shall be subject to a design and ICE check prior installation. After welding of the H-pile sections, splice plates and strengthening plates as shown on the contract drawings, shall be welded into position at each joint of the H-pile. This process will continue until the H-pile has been installed to the full depth of the pile. During welding, a spirit level will be used to ensure the straightness of the joint between the 2 steel\n## 8. **Safety (Risk Assessments)**\n\nA Risk Assessment is attached in Appendix A which has been prepared for all activities. The specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow. The Construction Manager, together with the RSO, will supervise the implementation and make adjustments where necessary to the actual site operations, in order to maintain a safe and amicable working environment.\n\n### Smoking Arrangement\n\nAll workers should possess the qualification Railway Safety Training (RSI), and can only smoke at the designated smoking area provided by CSHK.\n\n## 9. **Environmental (Environmental aspect & impact identification as well as mitigation measures)**\n\n- Works will be carried out during normal hours from 08:00 am to 07:00 pm. If necessary, works may need to be carried out after 07:00 pm on Monday to Sunday with an approved construction noise permit.\n- ULSD Diesel will be used in all PME; Plant with QPME label will be employed if available; Only regulated NRMM with approved NRMM label to be used on site.\n- All chemicals will be placed on a drip tray.\n- Any wastewater produced during the work will be treated prior to disposal.\n- The works shall follow relevant mitigation measures as required under the Environmental Permit (EP) / EP submission and Contractor’s Environmental Management Plan (EMP).\n\n## 10. **Quality Control (Inspection and Test Plan including hold points)**\n\nRefer to Appendix B for Inspection and Test Plan. To ensure the attainment of the required standard of works, the methods of working and the required works standards / acceptance criteria are defined in the method statement and inspection & test plans which are communicated to relevant staff and workers carrying out the works. Day-to-day routine inspections of the works will be carried out by the Construction Team Leader, Site Engineers, and Foreman as appropriate, to ensure that all works are performed following the requirements of these documents.\n\nSpecific quality checks shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Inspection & Test Plan with \"Hold Points\" at critical elements for confirmation of compliance before proceeding further. Request for Inspection and Survey Check (RISC) shall be issued to the MTR inspection team following inspection of the works by the CSHK's project team. The Inspection & Test Plan for the works (Appendix B) will identify all Hold Points and Witness Points.\n\nFollowing the Inspection & Test carried out, inspection and/or test records are to be prepared to indicate whether the specified requirements have been met. Records of Inspection and testing will be maintained and kept available for inspection and final handover as appropriate.\n\n## 11. **Appendices (Identify and include additional information in the submission package)**\n\n- **Appendix A** - Risk Assessment\n- **Appendix B** - Inspection and Test Plan (ITP)\n- **Appendix C** - Drawing\n- **Appendix D** - Plant Catalogue\n- **Appendix E** - Emergency Contact List\n\n---\n\nThis method statement provides a comprehensive guide for the installation of Socket H Pile at Bifurcation & OHL Mast, ensuring that all safety, environmental, and quality control measures are adhered to throughout the construction process."}]}

However, workers working in a distance less than 10m measuring from nearest track/OHL or any construction activities that may cause potential impact to the OA, the RSR and EDOC procedure still apply.\n\n| CA | Non-CA & OA |\n| --- | --- |\n| <10m Railway | EDOC required |\n| >10m Railway | EDOC not required |\n\nIn the below layout, the red area refers to area where EDOC is required which the distance between the track and the working area is less than 10m method statement will be submitted separately. While the yellow area denotes where we propose EDOC is not required which the distance between the track and working area is greater than 10m. In this method statement, we would cover the yellow part for bored piling only.\n\n- LDGENO1SA 80101 80401--25\n- Western Part of the depot\n- Eastern Part of the depot\n\n#### 7.2.2 General Access to works at W11 & W12\n\nThe delivery of plants and equipment shall be passed through the vehicular access bridge, we would also temporarily utilize west gate (or east gate) via the west level crossing to deliver those plants and materials of delivery height shall be restricted or less than 4.0m (e.g up to 80 ton crawler crane and 3.0m dia. steel casing) unless prior agreement obtained from the Depot. During delivery from West gate, escort vehicle with CPs would be deployed to escort the construction vehicles. CP(T) would be stationed at the West Gate to check the vehicular height and direct the traffic and communicate with the yard master continuously. Apart from the construction vehicles, shuttle escorted by escort vehicle would be arranged to directly carry the worker from West Gate to the Container Village at W11 via the West level crossing.\n\nWe would also utilize the East gate with the same height limit, similar safety procedure same as West Gate would be deployed. The necessary permits/forms adhered to the main contractor or MTRC will be filled up prior to the access of the machinery and machinery inspection to be carried out by the safety personnel and relevant party. Nonetheless, we would hold regular workshops with RP/Yard master to go through current works within all CAs in order to identify and review any impact upon railway and/or depot operation. The rules and procedures for Railway Protection under the Railway Ordinance will be in accordance with Practice Note for Authorized Persons, Registered Structural Engineers and Registered Geotechnical Engineers (PNAP ADV-33 / APP-24) and MTRCL working paper No.6-Railway Protection-Revision B-December 2022.\n\nThe detail of general logistics should refer to the submitted security and traffic management plan.\n\nIn each work area, there will be welfare facility and designated smoking points provided for workers. In each of smoking points, preventive fire measures would be provided as below.\n\nFacilities for Smoke Area\n\n- Cigarette Butt Receptacle\n- Fire Extinguisher\n- Sand Bucket\n\nPreventive fire measures at smoking point\n\nBelow shown the blow-up detail for W12\n\nIn the morning, workers would send to container village at W11 first for briefing and changing. After that, they will go to W12 by shuttle bus.\n\nBelow shown the blow-up detail for W11 (in 3 sections):\n\n- Bored pile not required EDOC\n\nGeneral layout for W11 (West)\n\nGeneral layout for W11 (Middle)\n\nGeneral layout for W11 (East)\n\nW11 would be divided into 3 major sections and at each section there will be an individual WPIC to supervise the construction activities. Each section would be fenced off and there will be also multiple gate openings reserved for exit and entry to prevent labours going around the site.\n\nFor the proposed layout of the logistic plan for the bored pilling works can refer to the Appendix I for the arrangement.\n\n#### 7.2.3 Logistics Arrangement: Temp Water and Electricity Supply\n\nDuring first few months of the project, temporary water would be sourced from the water pipe along the south road to W11. A 200mm recessed would be formed to bury the water pipe to across the South Road which is subjected to depot's approval and we would follow depot's procedure for obtaining the water.\n\n(1) Project's team colleague to read the Contractor's usage monthly and obtain the Contractor's agreement on the monthly usage.\n\n(2) Project's team to pass the agreed usage to Control & Support Officer - Opt & Metro- OpsPerf & Supp-Ctl & Sup) for calculation of the water costs with management cost\n\n(3) CMD's colleague to provide the calculation of the water costs to the Contractor to obtain their agreement before formal issuance of debit note/ invoice.\n\n(4) Asst Fin Mgr-Railway Cost Ct (Fin Control-HKTS) to issue the debit note/ invoice to the Contractor directly.\n\n(5) The Contractor to pay MTRCL directly.\n\n(6) Water usage record (i.e. Meter readings) to be emailed to SHD Dev. for reference each month.\n\nAfter connection to WSD water point at Tai Ho interchange, water pipe would be connected from Tai Ho Interchange and to W11 via the West level Crossing. Detail of connecting through the West Level Crossing shall refer to separate submission. Multiple location of Wetsep across the W11 and W12 to discharge the treated waste water. Below shown the sketch for the provision. Wetseps location at W11 and W12 are shown below. The water would be treated first at Wetsep and then discharged into nearest manhole which eventually leads to discharge of box culvert.

Construction Methods / Construction Sequence Drawings\n### 1. Methodology of temporary sewage treatment and diversion\nA temporary drainage proposal, including how the sewerage would be collected, conveyed and discharged to the site, would be submitted to DSD to demonstrate that the proposed use of the site would not have adverse drainage impacts on the drainage issue to the area. Upon the satisfactory drainage submission approved by DSD, the proposed drainage facilities as per our submissions shall be implemented and completed as soon as possible.\n\nIn general, a surface channel at the peripheral of the site should be constructed to intercept all such rain water falling onto the site. U-channel shall be located on the lower side to collect rain water from the site. Then sewage water/stormwater shall be collected by pump into catch pit (UU detection should be carried out before excavation for placing pre-cast catch pit), and “AquaSed” shall be equipped in every local area for sedimentation and treatment. We would take advantage of existing public drainage system by diverting wastewater/stormwater into manholes and gullies to discharge them. The flow chart of overall treatment process may refer to Figure 1.1.\n\n### 2. Checking of drainage for temporary purposes\na. The capacities of the existing drainage affected by the discharge of the additional construction generated waste water will be considered as an impact to the existing system and checked for the maximum capacity. The capacity calculation under review and will supplement later.\nb. The temporary drainage arrangement will be designed in accordance with DSD Technical Circular No. 1/2017 to ensure that the additional capacity as well as the surface run-off does not incur any adverse impact to the existing drainage system.\nc. There will be no significant alternation to the drainage pattern while treated water will be discharged to existing drainage system.\nd. The temporary drainage diversion will be checked and designed from time to time to suit the site activities.\ne. The sizes of existing drainage or permanent drainage pipelines designed by the Engineer form the basis to determine the minimum temporary pipeline sizes at the concerned locations.\n\n### 3. Proposed temporary drainage arrangement\nThe overall arrangement layout refers to Figure 1.1. The temporary drainage system will be provided and reviewed accordingly to cope with the construction progress.\n\n#### a. Area W12\nSewage in the Area W12 will be collected through U-channel constructed in this area into catch pit. Waste water stored in the catch pit shall be pumped into WetSep for treatment. And a 100mm dia. pipe is connected to nearby gully. After settling and reaching filtration requirements, waste water flows out from WetSep into gully through the 100mm link-up pipe. And then through the public drainage routing from M3.12.2 to M3.1, it is discharged into existing box culvert at the proposed discharge point M3.1.\n\n#### b. Area W3B/W3A/W3C/W7\nArea W3B, W3A, W3C and W7 are all Works Area in the north. Diverted waste water will be collected into “AquaSed”. Dispose wastewater if it is properly treated into gullies in their respective areas through 100mm dia. pipe, and then discharge it along the same route which is from M1.10 to M1.1 finally to public box culvert.\n\n#### c. Area W11 and W2\nFor Area W11, sewage due to the construction works will be conducted by u-channel into sump pit, and pumped into wetsep from sump pit. Then it goes to gully on south road via 100mm dia. pipe, finally flows into respective discharge point.\n\nFoundation work for that section of south road will be commenced around 3rd quarter 2025, drainage system will be reviewed and submit separately if required. For Area W2, we proposed to utilize the existing u-channel between AEL/ACL Track and Test Track to collect waste water. At the point where u-channel is approaching the existing final catch pit should be blocked downstream at each subsection, and the collected waste water will be pumped into pre-cast catch pit that is newly placed besides the u-channel. Then waste water is pumped into wetsep from pre-cast catch pit and well treated. After this, it will flow through the 100mm PVC drainage pipe which connects wetsep and existing final catch pit into discharge point.\n\n#### d. Area W6A\nThe set-up work for collection and treatment of wastewater is similar to general procedures in area W6A, and M3.1 will serve as discharge point in area W6A to do said disposal of wastewater.\n\n#### e. Area W1\nArea W1 is in the close vicinity to the public traffic. To enhance the drainage capacity and prevent flood and overflow water during rainy season, stand-by pump would be placed at the lowest point for diverting water rapidly to catch pit. The measure and set-up follow general procedures. SF12.5 will be the discharge point for this area.\n\n### 4. Cement bunding\nAs considering the water-filled barriers and various protective fences would be used for site fencing, the land bunding shall be provided for waste water’s diversion and closure. For the Works area fenced off by water-filled barriers, cement would be used to form a triangular shape paste at the internal bottom of the barriers to close off the water. For existing RP fencing on south road, cement paste which is approximately 100mm in thickness and 150mm high would be casted. For those newly installed fencing in different heights, bunding for preventing water from flowing out should also be casted in the fence-off area.\n\n### 5. Pipe Jacking\nPipe jacking will be conducted outside the Depot, so the wastewater shall be collected and treated before discharging into nearby existing public drain following general procedures.\n\n### 6. Maintenance for Temporary Drainage\nWeekly inspection of the temporary drainage pipes will be implemented during the wet season or before a heavy rain warning signal. The objective is to ensure that there is no obstruction to the drainage path and the system is function properly. Sediment may be accumulated from time to time in the manholes. Therefore, removal of siltation will be carried out inside manholes when accumulation is reported during the inspection. In case of any blockage is found, a high-pressure water jet would be mobilized to flush out the sediment and unblock the drain pipe. In addition, the sedimentation tanks will be cleaned regularly to ensure that are functioning properly at all times. Each inspection should be properly logged with the inspection results available for verification.\n\n### 7. Flood preventive maintenance\nWeekly inspection of the temporary drainage pipes will be implemented during the Wet Season or before a heavy rain warning signal. The objective is to ensure that there is no obstruction to the drainage path and the system is functioning properly.\n\n## 8. Safety (Risk Assessments)\nRisk Assessment attached in Appendix A has been prepared for all general activities. Specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow. The Construction Team Leader together with the Safety Team, will supervise the implementation and make adjustment according to the actual site operations, in order to maintain a safe and amicable working environment.\n\n### General Site Safety\nWith reference to the Project Safety Plan, the following items need to be instituted through the course of the works described within this method statement.\n1. All works carried out on the railway are supervised by a Contractor’s safety supervisor who has been qualified as a Competent Person (Track) [CP(T)] or a Competent Person (Non-Track) [CP(NT)]. Works are arranged so that the works are supervised at a minimum ratio of 1 CP(T)/CP(NT) to no more than 20 numbers of workers.\n2. Works area in the vicinity of carriageway will be fenced off from the public and appropriate signage will be clearly displayed.\n3. Proper PPE should be provided subject to type of task, including but not limited to safety helmets, reflective vests and safety shoes.\n4. Relevant training will be provided for all workers before the commencement of temporary drainage works. Tool box talks will be conducted regularly.\n5. All plant and equipment will be checked and approved. Only trained and licensed plant operators will be deployed.\n6. All the potential hazards, consequences and mitigations are analysed in the risk assessment attached in the Appendix A.\n\n## 9.

Construction Methods / Construction Sequence\n\n### Stage 1\n\n#### Step 1 Daywork\n\nNew batch of empty water filled barriers are loaded on flatbed of crane lorry and transported to designated unloading point on Shun Long road slow lane surrounded by water. Workers distribute and set up new set of water barriers with respect to survey marking provided on road. Make sure that water drain hole at the bottom position should be faced to SHW depot.\n\n#### Step 2 Daywork\n\nFill up empty water barrier. Water supply is gained from water tanker truck. Workers use accessories (hose reel) equipped on water truck to inject water upon fill hole on top. During the process, workers should monitor the water filled barrier alignment without beyond tolerance.\n\n#### Step 3 Daywork\n\nCheck the quality of water filled barrier, screw up the cover to prevent the water leakage.\n\n#### Step 4 Daywork\n\nThe barrier shall be placed in alternate red and white colours and connect together such that they stand out the construction site behind them and are visible by day and night.\n\n#### Step 5 Daywork\n\nFill in the water to the maximum water level of every water filled barrier according to the operating instructions of the manufacturer.\n\n#### Step 6 Daywork\n\nCheck whether the water level is between the lowest water level and the highest water level daily. If there is no water after a day, it means that the cover is loose or the barrier is broken, so we should tighten the cover or replace it with a new water-filled barrier.\n\n#### Step 7 Daywork\n\n6T telescoping crawler crane shall be used to relocate profile barrier at the bottom ground level near slope in order to create enough space for set-up new water filled barrier. Attach proper lifting gears upon two rigging points of every profile barrier. Double barrier is being lifted up, riggers should keep at least 3m clearance away from the barrier will move toward middle part of slow lane in 1m distance.\n\n#### Step 8 Daywork\n\nRepeat Step 1 to Step 7 until water filled barriers are full-loaded.\n\n#### Step 9 Nightwork\n\nRelease drain hole at the bottom position of existing water-filled barrier to discharge water from inside to outside. A few moments later, workers shall manually take away empty water filled barrier upon flatbed of crane lorry/flatbed truck. A traffic vehicle with LED arrow board is required to stay behind and keep proper distance with ahead crane lorry/flatbed truck to prevent any residual risk. Repeat above step for several times until both empty water filled barriers are being removed. This work will take place at midnight for secure reason. The numbers of vehicles on road will drop significantly therefore the opportunities to be hit is reduced.\n\n## 8. Safety (Risk Assessments)\n\nRisk Assessment attached in Appendix A has been prepared for all general activities. Specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow. The Construction Manager together with the RSO, will supervise the implementation and make adjustment according to the actual site operations, in order to maintain a safe and amicable working environment.\n\n## 9.

Plant, Equipment & Material\n\nAll plant and equipment will be inspected prior to mobilisation on site to ensure that they are in good working condition and comply with all current regulations. A plant permit system and permit to lift will be adopted to ensure the condition of the lifting crane and lifting equipment are checked before use. To meet the programme requirement, 3 work fronts will be mobilised for the WDET. The major plant and equipment that will be deployed to carry out the works are as follows:\n\n### Work Area at WDET: 3 no.

Vehicle height measurements/checks shall be conducted by CP(T)s before entering depot areas and passing through the west level crossing.\n\n### Worker Verification\n\n- All workers will be picked up at a designated collection point such as Tung Chung Station.\n- During boarding of the shuttle bus, hand-held facial recognition will be performed to verify the worker's qualification.\n- The facial recognition system will check if the person has passed the RSI and possesses a green card.\n- A list of workers will be submitted to MTR for registration before the start of works. The list shall be updated weekly and available for MTR as requested.\n\n### Uniform and Safety Equipment\n\nAll workers will wear PPE and the standard uniform and safety helmet for easy recognition by the security guards and YM.\n\n## 8. Construction Methods / Construction Sequence\n\n### 8.1 Site Clearance, Ground Levelling and Temporary Platform for WDET Fence Installation\n\nPrior to the RP fencing installation, site clearance and ground levelling will be carried out to remove vegetation, abandoned cable troughs by manual handling, remove cable manholes, track signage, and to level up the ground condition to create a level stable platform for RP fence installation. To meet the programme requirements, it is planned to have 3 work fronts at peak as shown in Figure 8.1-1 below.\n\nThe existing ground level varies slightly but in general lies between approx. 5.5m and 6.5mPD. This will be readily flattened by levelling; no high rockhead is known to be present in this area. Following levelling of the existing ground, a temporary working platform will be formed for subsequent works; granular sub-base will be used to fill and level up the existing ground condition and will be well compacted by vibratory rollers with repeated passes, with the actual number of passes to achieve the specified level of compaction subject to the weight of the roller.\n\n#### Steps:\n\n1. **Install Barrier (NPH)**: Water-filled barriers will be installed along both sides of the WDET (2.8m distance from the centre of the nearest track) to delineate a working area which can then be defined as a CA (Construction Area). All subsequent works, except for RP fence platform preparation and fence installation directly adjacent to the OHL infrastructure, can then be carried out during traffic hours (TH).\n\n2. **Remove Vegetation, Level and Compact Ground behind Water Barriers (TH)**: A 3 or 5-ton excavator, to suit availability, will be delivered to the works areas via the access roads. Site clearance and ground levelling will be carried out with the assistance of the excavator. In general, granular sub-base will be used for ground levelling. The sub-base, if required, will be delivered to the works area by 5.5-ton dump trucks. Rubbish removal and material delivery will be by manual delivery. For manual removal and delivery, access to the works areas will be via the existing west wheel wash road and south depot road.\n\n3. **Form the Working Platform for the RP Fence (NPH)**: This work will be carried out over the water-filled barriers and hence requires NPH. It is essentially the same as Step 2 but with the added railway precautions enabled by NPH working. Currently, it is not anticipated to remove the existing cable troughs, but rather to work around them.\n\n### 8.2 Install the Earthing System at Ground Level During TH\n\nAfter forming the temporary platform and compacting the sub-base, the electrode rod and earthing pit will be installed below the ground level at a maximum spacing of 20m along the proposed RP Fence, as shown in Figure 8.2-1.\n\n### 8.3 RP Fence Installation\n\nUpon completion of the site clearance and working platform, the RP fence installation will commence. The details of the RP fence setting out are shown in Appendix C. The sequence of work is as follows:\n\nConstruction works will be carried out in close proximity to the existing test track and WDET which require robust railway protection measures to be in place before commencement of any physical site works. Referring to (Library) Working Paper No.6 & the approved BUGN-Railway Protection (pending), a minimum 7 m high fence is proposed for activities which require the use of plant/machinery with high booms adjacent to the fence, or where the OHL masts are located on that side of the track. The minimum clearance between fence mesh and the OHL fault return wire is required to be at least 850 mm, but may be reduced with electrical isolation introduced, and with the agreement of MTRC.\n\nThe closest part of the fence structure is required to have a minimum of 2615 mm clearance to the track centre for tracks inside the depot (Scope Cl. S205.6.11(i)).\n\nAs the installation of the RP fence will be undertaken in close proximity to the OHL line (within 2m radius), an AP(E) and PTW(E) are also required to be provided. The RP Fence installation works will be undertaken during NPH after the OHL has been de-energised.\n\nThe footing and RP fence frame will be prefabricated off-site using a standard size to allow installation of the footing and fence frame directly on site. As the final distance between the OHL & RP fence will be only 150mm, an insulation coating is provided and installed on the RP fence at OHL level. The details of the 7m fence are shown in Figure 8.3-1. The tentative dimensions of the insulation coating can be referred to Figure 1.6. The concrete footings will be interlocked by PFC steel ties as shown in Figure 8.3-2. For the layout plan of the RP Fence please refer to Appendix C.\n\n## 9. Safety\n\n## 10. Environmental\n\n## 11. Quality Control\n\n## 12. Appendices\n## 9. Safety\n\nSafety is paramount in all construction activities, especially when working in close proximity to operational railway lines. The following safety measures will be implemented:\n\n- **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** All workers will wear appropriate PPE including helmets, high-visibility vests, gloves, and safety boots.\n- **Railway Safety Training (RSI):** All workers will have completed RSI training and will be familiar with the specific risks associated with railway environments.\n- **Site Induction:** All personnel will undergo a site-specific induction covering the scope of works, safety procedures, emergency protocols, and specific risks.\n- **Toolbox Talks:** Regular toolbox talks will be conducted to address specific tasks, potential hazards, and safety measures.\n- **Safety Inspections:** Daily safety inspections will be carried out by the Safety Officer to ensure compliance with safety protocols.\n- **Emergency Procedures:** Emergency procedures will be established and communicated to all workers. Emergency contact numbers will be displayed prominently on site.\n- **First Aid:** First aid facilities and trained first aid personnel will be available on site at all times.\n- **Isolation of OHL:** The OHL will be de-energized, earthed, and isolated before any work commences near the OHL infrastructure.\n\n## 10. Environmental\n\nEnvironmental considerations are integral to the project. The following measures will be implemented to minimize environmental impact:\n\n- **Noise Control:** Works will be carried out during normal hours from 08:00 am to 07:00 pm and outside of normal hours after 07:00 pm on Monday to Sunday with an approved construction noise permit.\n- **Use of ULSD Diesel:** Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) will be used in all Plant and Machinery Equipment (PME).\n- **QPME Label:** Plant with Quality Powered Mechanical Equipment (QPME) label will be used if available.\n- **NRMM Label:** Only plant with Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) label will be used unless exempted.\n- **Chemical Management:** All chemicals will be placed on a drip tray to prevent spillage.\n- **Wastewater Management:** Any wastewater produced during the work will be treated prior to disposal.\n- **Environmental Permit Compliance:** The works shall follow relevant mitigation measures as required under the Environmental Permit (EP) / EP submission and Contractor's Environmental Management Plan (EMP).\n\n## 11. Quality Control\n\nTo ensure the attainment of the required standard of works, the following quality control measures will be implemented:\n\n- **Inspection and Test Plan (ITP):** Refer to Appendix B for the ITP. The methods of working and the required work standards/acceptance criteria are defined in the method statement and ITP.\n- **Routine Inspections:** Day-to-day routine inspections of the works will be carried out by the Construction Team Leader, Site Engineers, and Foreman to ensure compliance with the method statement and ITP.\n- **Hold Points and Witness Points:** Specific quality checks shall be carried out in accordance with the approved ITP with \"Hold Points\" at critical elements for confirmation of compliance before proceeding further.\n- **Request for Inspection and Survey Check (RISC):** RISC shall be issued to the Resident Site Staff (RSS) following inspection of the works by the CSHK's project team.\n- **Inspection Records:** As each inspection and test is completed, records will be prepared to indicate whether the specified requirements have been met. These records will be maintained and kept available for inspection and final handover.\n\n## 12.

W1 area is shown above. As it is outside the existing railway fencing area and fully enclosed, it's not classified as an Operational Area and we propose that workers working in this Works Area are not required to have obtained RSI training. Due to the large amount of vegetation, workers will be deployed to clear the weeds and bushes before erection of the water filled barriers. If it is found that there are existing trees to be felled, MTR/Railway Protection shall be informed in advance. If there is risk affecting the safe operation of the Railway, it may be necessary to carry out tree removal during NTH of the Railway with MTR/Railway Protection in attendance.\n\n### 7.2 Labour Access to W1\n\nAll workers will be picked up from a designated area such as Tung Chung Station. As workers board the shuttle bus, hand-held facial recognition will be performed to verify the worker's qualification. The facial recognition system will check if the person has passed the RSI and possesses a green card. A list of workers shall be submitted to MTR for registration before the start of works and shall be updated weekly and available for MTR as requested. All workers shall wear PPE and the standard uniform for easy recognition by security guards and the YM.\n\n### 7.2.1 Plant Access to W1\n\nA 3T backhoe will be mobilised to carry out the site clearance works which includes removing the weeds and garbage. A Banksman will supervise all plant movement to prevent any damage to the RP fencing. The weeds near the track area will be removed as soon as possible to mitigate any fire risk within close proximity to the railway. All removed vegetation will be temporarily stored at the skip near the gate access. Water spray will be carried out during the work to prevent dust generation and reduce fire risks. Firefighting equipment will also be provided for each front. To remove the cleared vegetation and garbage off site, CSHK will arrange a grab lorry to collect and dispose accordingly. Height checking for crane lorry will be conducted on site before lifting.\n\n### 7.3 Water filled Barrier erection\n\nAfter removal of the vegetation, water filled barriers will be erected along the RP fencing to act as buffer between the works area for future site works. The barrier shall be placed in alternate red and white colours and connected together such that they are clearly visible from the construction site by day and night. The water barriers shall be filled to the maximum water level according to the operating instructions of the manufacturer. As W1 is segregated from other works area, we will use a water truck or bowser to deliver the water for filling. Water filled barriers would also surround the column and abutment to protect the existing structures. To prevent unauthorised access onto the live Operating Railway area by using the water filled barriers as a means of access, the water filled barriers shall be fixed at least 2m away from the existing Railway Fence.\n\n## 8. **Safety**\n\nThe Risk Assessment attached in Appendix A has been prepared for all general activities. Specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow. The Construction Team Leader together with the RSO, will supervise the implementation and make adjustment according to the actual site operations, in order to maintain a safe and amicable working environment.\n\n## 9. **Environmental**\n\n- General works shall be carried out during normal hours from 0800 to 1900. No works will be carried out after 1900 on weekdays, Sundays and public holiday without approval construction noise permit.\n- Only regulated NRMM with approved NRMM label to be used on site.\n- ULSD diesel will be used in all PME.\n- QPME plant will be deployed if available.\n- The works shall follow relevant mitigation measures as required under the Environmental Permit (EP)/EP submission and Contractor's Environmental Management Plan (EMP).\n\n## 10. **Quality Control**\n\nTo ensure the attainment of the required standard of works, the methods of working and the required works standards / acceptance criteria are defined in the method statement, inspection & test plans, and are communicated to relevant staff and workers carrying out the works. Day to day routine inspections of the works will be carried out by the Construction Team Leader, Site Engineers and Foreman as appropriate, to ensure that all works are performed following the requirements of these documents. Specific quality checks shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Inspection & Test Plan with \"Hold Points\" at critical elements for confirmation of compliance before proceeding further. Request for Inspection and Survey Check (RISC) shall be issued to the RSS following inspection of the works by the CSHK's project team. The Inspection & Test Plan for the works (Appendix B) will identify all Hold Points and Witness Points. Following the Inspection & Test carried out, inspection and /or test records are to be prepared to indicate whether the specified requirements have been met. Records of Inspection and testing will be maintained and kept available for inspection and final handover as appropriate.\n\n## 11. **Appendices**\n\nAppendix A - Risk Assessment  \nAppendix B - Catalogue for 3T backhoe  \nAppendix C - Emergency Contact List"}]}

Plant, Equipment & Material (Identify type, model and specification of MAJOR plant & equipment)\n\nAll plants and equipment will be inspected prior to the mobilization on site to ensure that they are in good working condition and comply with the current regulations. The major plants and equipment will be deployed to carry out the works are as follow:\n\n### 6.1 Survey Vessel\nA survey vessel will be equipped with a single-beam echo sounder and computer with logging software. The transducer will be mounted on a side of the vessel. An electric-power-generator/uninterruptible power source (UPS battery) is required in order to provide the power to the above hardware.\n\n### 6.2 Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS)\n- **Device Name**: Trimble DGPS Receiver SPS356\n- Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) is recommended for positioning of the sailing vessel. The differential signal broadcasts at Kau Yi Chau will be integrated with the GPS data in the device to provide a real-time positioning coordinates, and the coordinates will be transformed into the Hong Kong 1980 Coordinates System. With reference to the brochure of the DGPS, the differential position accuracy is about 1m.\n\n### 6.3 Echo-sounder\n- **Device Name**: Echotrac MK III\n- Bathymetric data will be collected by the echo sounder with a narrow beam transducer. The performance had been maintained at 0.01m +/-0.1% of depth @200kHz total depth of which depends on the accuracy of sound velocity input. The output of echo sounder had been the depth of seabed. Depth had been logged to the computer devices.\n\n### 6.4 Software\nHYPACK will be used for integrating survey equipments, capturing survey data and data reduction.\n\n### 6.5 Computer\nA desktop/laptop computer with recommended specification of the software will be used to run the software during the survey.\n\n### 6.6 Government Tide Database\nGovernment closest tide station’s data would be used for tide reading. The closest tide station is at Chek Lap Kok.\n\n### 6.7 Bar Check Plate and Chain\nThe Bar Check plate is around 600mm in diameter and 3-5 mm thick with 5x100mm diameter hole evenly distributed on the plate. The bar check should be around 5kg in weight. The interval starts from the top of the plate. Every one meter there would be a marker on the chain.\n\n## 7. Preparation of Survey\n\n### 7.1 Survey Area\nThe hydrographic survey boundary is provided from client’s information. Below is the approximated survey boundary.\n\n### 7.2 Proposed schedule of record survey\nThe field survey is proposed to be last for 1 working day. The subject site should be clear without blocking during the field survey. The working Permit will be also applied from Marine Department before survey if it is needed. CSHK will liaise and seek approval from HKTS / depot/C7. CSHK will check the exact date of survey works with HKTS and depot to ensure that no operations need of the barging point on that date.\n\n## 8. Survey Methods\n\n### 8.1 Calibration of Equipment\n\n#### 8.1.1 Instruments\nAll instruments shall be calibrated by equipment certificating company once a year. Certificate will then be issued after calibration to ensure all instrument are in good condition, Instrument without calibration certificate or with expired certificate are not allowed to use within the site area and will be labelled. Calibration certificate is attached.\n\n#### 8.1.2 DGPS\nDGPS will be calibrated by setting it on known control station prior and after the sounding operation. The DGPS receiver will be mounted well. Satellite signal will be logged and computed for positioning comparison. If the position logged by the DGPS is within tolerance (+/-1m) of the coordinates of control station, the calibration is acceptable.\n\n#### 8.1.3 Bar Check Method\nBar check test will be followed to determine the correctness for the echo sounding equipment. A steel plate will be lowered underneath the transducer. The chain linked to the steel plate shall be marked with 1m interval. At the beginning, the plate will be lowered to 2m depth, to calibrate the draft of the transducer. The steel plate then will be lowered to the deepest section to be surveyed. Before the bar check, the sound velocity will be adjusted to eliminate the difference between reading and the depth of steel plate. After that, the steel plate will be raised meter by meter and the reading recorded on echo roll paper will also be checked for any discrepancy. Re-adjustment of sound velocity and calibration is necessary if the reading is different from the pre-determined depth.\n\n#### 8.1.4 HDOP of Satellites\nThe value of HDOP, horizontal dilution of precision, is indicating the positional precision. The meaning of HDOP value is as shown below:\n\n| HDOP Value | Rating    | Description                                                                                       |\n|------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| <1         | Ideal     | Highest possible confidence level to be used for applications demanding the highest possible precision at all times. |\n| 1-2        | Excellent | At this confidence level, positional measurements are considered accurate enough to meet all but the most sensitive applications. |\n| 2-5        | Good      | Represents a level that marks the minimum appropriate for making business decisions. Positional measurements could be used to make reliable in-route navigation suggestions to the user. |\n| 5-10       | Moderate  | Positional measurements could be used for calculations, but the fix quality could still be improved. A more open view of the sky is recommended. |\n| 10-20      | Fair      | Represents a low confidence level. Positional measurements should be discarded or used only to indicate a very rough estimate of the current location. |\n| >20        | Poor      | At this level, measurements are inaccurate by as much as 300 meters with a 6-meter accurate device (50 DOP × 6 meters) and should be discarded. |\n\nThe value of HDOP of satellites received during the survey will be monitored and recorded.\n\n### 8.2 Preparation of Plan lines\nPre-assigned survey lines will be allocated to cover the entire sounding portion. The principle of designing the survey lines would either be 5m section intervals normal to the base line or 5m fixed intervals. In addition, reasonable check lines shall be performed normal to the survey line. The interval of check line usually adopted as 40m or minimal of 2-3 check lines to be adopted.\n\n### 8.3 Field Survey\nSurvey vessel speed will be kept in a constant speed, generally 3-5 knots will be applied which causing no intolerable distortion to the sounding records. The software will be set to mark on the data file and sounding paper in every 5m. The interval will be set in distance instead of time because the sampling rate by time had been affected by speed of the boat. The marks would be evenly distributed along the cross section if marks were taken by distance intervals. The sounding will be recorded in the computer by 0.1s intervals; it means 0.15m intervals at speed of 3 knot. A minimum of 2-3 check lines should be run for ensure the quality of the sounding data.\n\n### 8.4 Tide Reading\nThe closest government tide gauge Chek Lap Kok will be constantly booked during the period of the survey with readings being taken in 10 minutes interval throughout that period.\n\n### 8.5 Data reduction\n\n#### 8.5.1 Data reduction and Editing\nA software Hypack will be used for reducing the raw data. The corrections, such as tide, will be applied to the raw data and reduced to Hong Kong Principal Datum (H.K.P.D.). After applying the corrections, the noise, such as bubbles, fishes, unpredictable errors, will be removed. Then, the data will be reduced into point-form and the outliers will be removed by comparing the data in different survey-lines.\n\n#### 8.5.2 Sorting\nAfter the data editing, the shallowest depth points will be selected, for the scale of 1:500 using A2 paper, in their true position soundings’ cell size would be The processing data sign should be positive within Hypack program.\n\n#### 8.5.3 Deliverables\nList of common:\n- (a) Sounding\n- (b) Raw sounding\n- (c) Hard copy runlines;\n- (d) Survey report accuracies\n\n#### 8.5.4 Presentation\nA sounding plotted on the sounding plan would be without negative sign.

Introduction\n\nFor the construction of the north bifurcation works, access and material delivery shall be via the level crossings to be installed across the existing test track (method statement to be submitted separately). Due to the site constraint between the mainline and the Test Track it is not possible to maintain a site haul road throughout the works area during foundation works, especially at the east of works area W2 due to the existing exposed rock head and sloping ground profile. To support the construction work, a lifting method over the Test Track has been considered as alternative means of delivery. In general, a mobile crane will be set up at the South Road and Works Area W11G for lifting material/equipment over the test track to the works areas between the test track and the mainline. All lifting works over the Test track are subject to EDOC and BUGN approval and it has been agreed with RP/HKTS to prepare this general lifting method statement so as to shorten the approval time. This method statement covers all lifting operations for the delivery of material/equipment above and across the live Test Track to Works Area W2. Typically, this includes 4.5m/7m RP fence material, piling material (socket H pile & mini pile), sheet piles, rebar, excavation spoil removal, other construction materials etc. The detailed arrangement is described in the following sections.\n\n## 2.

Figure 7.2 below shows the routing of vehicle access:\n\n**Figure 7.2 - Access to Northern Work Area after Opening of the Vehicle Access Bridge**\n\nFor details of the security and traffic arrangement please refer to the Security and Traffic Management (Main Stage) under separate submission.\n\n## 8. Construction Methods / Construction Sequence\n\n### 8.1 Lifting Arrangement\n\nThe works at W2 is planned to have 6 work-fronts, hence lifting work is expected to be required at each work-front. Figures 8.1 to 8.8 show the mobile crane siting and lifting arrangement at each location. In general, an 80-ton mobile crane will be set up on the South Road & Works Area W11G (north side of the test track), from where construction materials will be lifted to the Bi-furcation Works Area (W2) between the test track and mainline. The longest distance on plan from the 80-ton mobile crane position on the South Road to the construction area is 21m as shown in Figure 8.4. The concrete blocks for the RP Fence will be lowered down close to ground level (around 1m above) centrally between the Test Track and Mainline and then positioned laterally in place. A \"stopper” will be fixed on the concrete block prior to lifting to guide the subsequent mesh fence installation (Figure 8.5). The test track OHL shall be de-energized for lifting work for the RP fence on the north side of W2 during NPH. For the south side of W2, lifting shall be carried out during test track NTH. The selection of the 80-ton mobile crane is required to suit lifting of the heaviest material at the largest radius, with this size of crane then being used for all material lifting. As shown in Table 6.1 - Materials List (to be lifted), the concrete block for the RP fence is the heaviest material. As a result, an 80-ton mobile crane will be utilised. When the outriggers are fully extended, the width required is 8m. The width of the south road is 8.5m, which is sufficient for the 80-ton mobile crane to work. Mobile cranes will not be deployed at the intersection of South Road to ensure that other vehicles go to North Road.\n\n**Figure 8.1 – Layout Plan of G.L. ~80**\n\n**Figure 8.2 – Layout Plan of G.L. ~100**\n\n**Figure 8.3 – Layout Plan of G.L. ~40, Works Area W11G**\n\n**Figure 8.4 – Elevation Plan for Cable Bridge**\n\n**Figure 8.6 – “Stopper” Bar**\n\n**Figure 8.7 – Section GL A3**\n\n**Figure 8.9 – Section GL80**\n\n**Figure 8.10 – Section GL100**\n\n### 8.2 Load Chart of 80-ton Mobile Crane\n\nAn 80-ton mobile crane will be set up at the South Road & Works Area W11G, to lift over the existing test track RP fence and OHL with a minimum boom angle of 60°. At the maximum horizontal distance of 21m, the lifting height of the mobile crane is 30m.\n\n### 8.3 Safe Working Load Checking\n\nRefer to **Figure 8.3 – 80-ton Mobile Crane Load Chart**, at a working range of 22m and lifting height of 30m, the maximum lifting capacity is 11.6 tons.\n\nMax.

Construction Methods\n\n### 7.1 Treatment of Excavated Marine Deposit\n\nCSHK will explore on the feasibility for the reuse of sediment as backfilling materials on site. The revised sediment quality report (SQR) submitted by MTR to Environmental Protection Department (EPD) under letter ref. (7) in EP 60/G1/12-637 (Pt. III) dated 4 August 2022 was approved by EPD till 1 July 2024. Refer Appendix A for Sediment Sample Locations and Sediment Categorisation Plan.\n\nReferring to contract S205.10.7, III(b), it is noted that CSHK should:\n(a) reuse the excavated land-based marine sediment as far as possible within the Site before considering disposal, at least 300 m3 will be reused as backfilling material on site. Marine disposal option for the land-based marine sediment should only be considered as the last resort upon exhaustion of reuse options, and only be implemented with acceptance by the Project Manager and approval by EPD (DASO); and\n(b) review the availability of suitable location within the Site and explores possible backfilling methods such that the excavated land-based marine sediment is feasible to be reused as backfilling materials on site.\n\nAs noted from the revised SQR report, an estimated 12,103 m3 of marine sediment are required to be excavated under the Project. Based on the screening results and categorisation plan, approximately 10,741 m3 of sediment would be suitable for Type 1 (Open Sea Disposal), 1,132 m3 of sediment would be suitable for Type 1 (Dedicated Site Disposal) and 230 m3 for Type 2 (Confined Marine Disposal).\n\n| Total Sediment (in-situ) | Type 1 (Open Sea Disposal) | Type 2 (Dedicated Site Disposal) | Type 2 (Confirmed Marine Disposal) |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| 12,103 m3                | 10,741 m3                  | 1,132 m3                         | 230 m3                             |\n\n###### Table.1 – Types of marine sediment\n\nAs stated in section 7.1(b) above, CSHK will explore on the feasibility for the reuse of sediment as backfilling materials on site. Approximately 100 m3 of the uncontaminated Category L sediment is proposed to be reused on-site as backfilling materials and the backfilling area is shown in Appendix B. In addition, approximately 10641 m3 excavated marine deposit will be disposed to designated locations.\n\nFor marine deposit that meet the testing standards, will be regarded as reusable materials, CSHK will use for backfilling in designated areas, on the contrary, it cannot be reused. The treatment standards, techniques, and requirements will be presented in subsequent chapters.\n\n### 7.1.1 Marine Deposit Treatment Standard\n\nCSHK will follow the EPD’s Practice Guide for Investigation and Remediation of Contaminated Land (Practice Guide) to test and treat the contaminated sediment for reuse of the treated sediments with reference to the Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) and the Universal Treatment Standards (UTS), which specify the Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test limits as given in Table.2 of the Practice Guide, as shown in Table.1 below. The UCS criteria should be equal to or greater than 350 kPa.\n\n| Parameters (1)(2) | TCLP Limit (mg/L) |\n|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Antimony          | 1.15              |\n| Arsenic           | 5                 |\n| Barium            | 21                |\n| Cadmium           | 0.11              |\n| Total Chromium    | 0.6               |\n| Lead              | 0.75              |\n| Mercury           | 0.025             |\n| Nickel            | 11                |\n| Zinc              | 4.3               |\n\nTable.2 - Universal Treatment Standards for On-site Reuse of Cement Stabilization/Solidification Treated Soil\n\nNotes:\n1. Universal Treatment Standard – US 40 CFR 268.48\n\n2. For other metal contaminants under the risk-based remediation goals (RBRGs) e.g. Cobalt, Copper, Manganese, Molybdenum and Tin, they must be reduced by at least 90 percent in mobility for respective metals through cement stabilization / solidification remedial treatment. The reduction of mobility of metal contaminants (leachable metals contaminants) should be confirmed through TCLP tests (i.e. to carry out TCLP test for the untreated soil and for the soil after treatment and to compare the concentrations of the metals in the leachates). Taking into account the sediment under treatment are uncontaminated Category L sediment, the treatment criteria for these other metal contaminants are considered met if the concentrations of cobalt, copper, manganese, molybdenum and tin are below the RBRGs for Urban Residential land use scenario (for railway depot with residential / commercial development above) under EPD’s issued Guidance Manual for Use of Risk-Based Remediation Goals for Contaminated Land Management or, if exceeded the respective RBRGs, the TCLP levels of the concerned metal contaminant(s) in the samples taken after treatment is reduced by at least 90 percent in mobility or smaller than the limit of reporting (LOR).\n\n| Chemical   | RBRGs for Urban Residential land use scenario (mg/kg) |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cobalt     | 1480                                                  |\n| Copper     | 2950                                                  |\n| Manganese  | 10000*                                                |\n| Molybdenum | 369                                                   |\n| Tin        | 10000*                                                |\n\nTable.3 - Relevant Risk-Based Remediation Goals (RBRGs) for Cobalt, Copper, Manganese, Molybdenum and Tin\n\nNote:\n*Indicates a ‘ceiling limit’ concentration.\n\n### 7.1.2 Marine Deposit Treatment Technique\n\nThe sediment would be treated using stabilization / solidification (S/S) technique prior to reuse by mixing with cement (e.g. Portland cement). The sediment will be provided with the necessary strength and contaminants (if any) in the sediment will be immobilised in the cement/sediment mix after the S/S process.\n\nPilot-scale trial will be carried out before the commencement of treatment to determine the optimal cement/sediment ratio (by weight) and curing time that could achieve the treatment standards (e.g. 80% of sediment with 5% Portland cement and 15% in-situ granular / sand material; curing time of 4 days).\n\nThe sediment treatment facility is expected to be located within the project site depending on the construction phasing. The treatment process is expected to begin with initial mixing of the sediments with in-situ granular / sand materials in batches using an excavator and/or backhoe. Cement slurry will then be added to the initially mixed sediment for the S/S process. The treated sediments shall be placed at a temporary storage area covered by tarpaulin sheets and securely fixed by sandbags, while samples are taken for laboratory testing.\n\nThe treated materials will be tested for the Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP) and Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) and will meet the Universal Treatment Standards (UTS) with reference to the Practice Guide and the UCS criteria prior to reuse. Sediments that meet the treatment standards are considered suitable for reuse on site. In the event that the treated materials did not meet the UTS and UCS standards, the materials should be treated with a higher cement content (e.g. 10%, 20% or 30%). The re-treated samples should be taken for laboratory testing again for TCLP and UCS to confirm if they can be reused on site. Once the UTS and UCS for the relevant tested parameters is attained, the revised cement content should be maintained for treatment.\n\nTo maximize cost benefit and environment value, the optimum mix of cement stabilized marine deposit should contain minimum content of Portland cement, maximum content of marine deposit and adequate content of granular material. The mix proportions of the site trial are shown in Table. 4.\n\n| Trial Mix | Portland Cement | Granular Material | Marine Sediment |\n|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| 1         | 5%              | 15%               | 80%             |\n| 2         | 10%             | 15%               | 75%             |\n| 3         | 15%             | 15%               | 70%             |\n| 4         | 20%             | 15%               | 65%             |\n| 5         | 25%             | 15%               | 60%             |\n| 6         | 30%             | 15%               | 55%             |\n\nTable.4 – Mix Proportions\n\n### 7.1.3 Sampling and Testing Requirements\n\nThe untreated and treated sediment samples will be collected using stainless steel hand tools and contained in appropriate containers as provided by the laboratory. Sufficient sample will be taken to fill up the container upon sample collection. All sampling tools will be decontaminated by thoroughly washing with phosphate-free detergent and then rinsing by distilled water.\n\nThe testing frequency will be one sample per 50 m3 of untreated / treated sediment or one sample per batch of untreated / treated sediment if a batch of untreated / treated sediment is less than 50 m3. Any treated samples to be submitted to laboratory for TCLP analysis should be broken up to small pieces with maximum diameter of 10cm.\n\nThe sampling and testing schedule are presented in Table. 5 below.\n\n| Stage         | Sampling Frequency                                                                 | Types of Testing                      |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|               |                                                                                    | Metals Content in Sediment | TCLP Test | UCS |\n| Pre-Treatment | 1 sample per 50 m3 of sediment or 1 sample per batch of sediment if a batch of sediment is less than 50 m3 | 1(Co, Cu, Mn, Mo and Sn only) | 1(Co, Cu, Mn, Mo and Sn only) | N/A |\n| After Treatment | 1 sample per 50 m3 of treated sediment or 1 sample per batch of treated sediment if a batch of treated sediment is less than 50 m3 | N/A | 2(all parameters) | |\n\nTable.5 - Sampling and Testing Schedule\n\nNotes:\n1.

Construction Methods / Construction Sequence\n\n### 7.1 Preparation work before TTM Implementation\n\nPrior to commencement of the re-surfacing work, preparation of the road closure and TTM plan is required. As per the TTM plan (refer to appendix C), temporary road signage is to be installed and several existing signs leading from the Sky City Interchange to be modified. To maximize the available working hours for the road re-surfacing work, all temporary signage will be installed in advance of road closure and covered by black plastic sheet which will be removed as the TTA is installed.\n\nIn this TTM scheme, the entire length of the elevated Shun Long Road Westbound to Kowloon will be closed from 22:00 to 06:00. During this closure, all traffic from Chek Lap Kok road towards Kowloon will be diverted to the Eastbound carriageway of the Lantau Highway to Tung Chung East Interchange to then turn back onto the Westbound carriageway towards Kowloon. The existing TTA water filled barrier at the existing site entrance on Shun Long Road may be partially removed to allow for mobilization of plant during the works. The TTM water filled barrier will be reinstated prior to re-opening of the road.\n\n### 7.2 TTM Implementation\n\nThe closure of Shun Long Road will commence at 22:30 subject to acceptable traffic flows to allow the road closure to be implemented. All temporary signage shall be uncovered by 22:30. A Traffic Mounted Attenuator (TMA) with FAS will be positioned at the front of the merge point of the road, as shown in the above sketch, to protect the workers during placing of the traffic cone to implement the road closure. A traffic marshall will be provided to guide the road user to the diversion route. Implementation of the TTA road closure is planned to be complete by 23:00. Traffic Marshalls will open the cones locally at the road closure to allow construction vehicles to enter the works site.\n\n### 7.3 Resurfacing work\n\nFrom 23:00 to 05:00, re-surfacing work will be carried out on the elevated Shun Long Road. The work comprises of the following steps:\n\n**Step 1:** Set out of the extent of the asphalt to be removed, starting 10.9m east of the bridge abutment for a length of 40m west (refer to figure.1 for details). The full width of the fast lane from the existing parapet to the road centre line shall be removed in accordance with the relevant guidance note.\n\n**Step 2:** Mobilize all the asphalt plant inside the existing TTM entrance near W1.\n\n**Step 3:** Cold Planer to mill down the 30 mm thk. friction course and 45~50mm wearing course. The horizontal, longitudinal and lapping joint will be saw-cut and broke. A road washing truck will clean out all the bituminous debris prior to application of the tack coat.\n\n**Step 4:** Asphalt workers will mark out the wearing course and finishing level of the road as per the as-built level provided by Hyd. Tack coat must be applied evenly on the base course and concrete profile barrier/parapet which will be in-contact with the bitumen to ensure bonding of the bitumen.\n\n**Step 5:** Load the paving machine with bitumen and check the temperature of the fresh bitumen as laid prior to compaction (for the temperature required at laying for the polymer modified friction course and wearing course, refer to the manufacturers specification). The paver shall lay in one direction with the loading truck in front, laying of east to west is preferred. The level of the wearing course can be adjusted using the paver screed. Each run will cover the full width of a single lane. The longitudinal joint shall be formed coincident with the location of the white lining. Bulk samples shall be taken from the loading truck directly for testing. Core sample is not required for PMFC, required for wearing course with minimum 2 nos. as required from Hyd.\n\n**Step 6:** The wearing course will be compacted by a vibratory tandem steel-wheeled roller with a mass between 6T to 12T in the longitudinal direction. For PMFC, a pneumatic-tyre roller shall not be used for compaction. Where the bitumen is laid adjacent to kerbs, covers and frames where rollers cannot operate effectively, these areas shall be compacted using hand-operated mechanical compaction.\n\n**Step 7:** After compaction of the wearing course is completed, repeat the laying and compaction steps for polymer modified friction course. Tack coat is not required between wearing & friction course if the laying is within a few hours, as stated in RN/GN/039 p.19.\n\n**Step 8:** Road marking team set out the road marking on road. Reinstatement of road marking shall refer to the Transport Planning & Design Manual Volume 3 clause 5.4.2.3. For a speed limit of 70km/h or more, RM1102 shall be used for the middle lane line marking. For the hard shoulder, RM1109 shall be used. Road studs to be reinstated as per figure.13.\n\n**Step 9:** Final inspection of the road before removal of TTM.\n\n**Step 10:** As-built readings taken for reinstated friction road at day-time.\n\n### 7.4 Road opening\n\nAfter the bitumen and road marking are complete, site clearance and inspection will be conducted to check and remove any leftover objects or debris which may jeopardize the traffic users. A final clean of the road using the road brush will be completed prior to re-opening the road. TTM teams will be used to remove the TTM and temporary signage. Once the TTM is removed, the signage can be reinstated or removed. The road will be re-opened at 05:00.\n\n## 8. Safety\n\nThe Risk Assessment attached in Appendix A has been prepared for all general activities. Specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow. The Construction Team Leader together with the RSO, will supervise the implementation and make adjustment according to the actual site operations, in order to maintain a safe and amicable working environment.\n\n## 9. Environmental\n\nWorks will be carried out during an overnight road closure of Shun Long Road from 22:30 to 05:00, provisionally scheduled to commence on Friday 12th July 2024. The works will only be carried out when the CNP or EO for the road re-surfacing at the elevated Shun Long Road is granted.\n\n- ULSD diesel will be used in all PME.\n- Plant with QPME label will be employed, if available.\n- All chemicals will be placed on drip trays.\n- The works shall follow relevant mitigation measures as required under the Environmental Permit (EP)/ EP submission and Contractor's Environmental Management Plan (EMP).\n\n## 10. Quality Control\n\nRefer to Appendix B for Inspection and Test Plan. To ensure the attainment of the required standard of works, the methods of working and the required works standards/acceptance criteria are defined in the method statement, inspection & test plans, and are communicated to relevant staff and workers carrying out the works. Day to day routine inspections of the works will be carried out by the Construction Team Leader, Site Engineers and Foreman as appropriate, to ensure that all works are performed following the requirements of these documents. Specific quality checks shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Inspection & Test Plan with \"Hold Points\" at critical elements for confirmation of compliance before proceeding further. The Inspection & Test Plan for the works (Appendix B) will identify all Hold Points and Witness Points.\n\nFollowing the Inspection & Test carried out, inspection and/or test records are to be prepared to indicate whether the specified requirements have been met.

The operator raises the mast slowly by increasing the pressure of the mast hydraulic cylinder. Then the mast legs would only be fixed at the designated position and safety pin would be inserted to secure and lock the mast in vertical direction before releasing the pressure at the hydraulic jack. During lowering procedure of the mast, the operator should be gradually increasing the pressure of the hydraulic cylinder to hold the mast by which the safety pin at the backstay legs can only be removed. Then by releasing the hydraulic cylinder, the rig mast can gradually lower until it’s in a horizontal position.\n\n#### 7.4 Sampling\n\nBy using the rigs hydraulics, the drilling carriage is raised and the sampler is screwed and attached onto the anvil adaptor. The carriage is then lowered until the tentative sampling level. The hydraulic cylinder of the drilling rig is lowered and the drop-weight is activated, driving the sampler into the ground. Once the sampling tube has been driven to its full length, the hydraulic cylinder is activated pulling the sampler from the ground.\n\nAfter retrieval of sample, casing will be drilled for the flushing cleaning of hole before next sampling. Then, sampling will be continued by successively adding drill rods between the sampler the anvil adaptor.\n\n#### 7.5 Sample Handling\n\nAll Core samples shall be stored in core boxes which shall be of sound robust timber construction and be able to withstand the weight of the cores. The Contract numbers, drill hole number, depth, date of drilling shall be clearly marked on the side, inside and outside lid of the core box with permanent ink.

Standard for Arboricultural Operations (ANSI Z133) - Safety Requirements.\n- Before starting any tree felling work, the supervisor will coordinate with site representative to ensure that no trees are felled wrongly. All trees to be felled shall be confirmed and double-checked by the Supervisor.\n- Cherry picker/ working platform/ crane lorry will be used, if necessary, to facilitate the removal of tree by pieces and it will be temporarily parked inside the site only. During the working at height on the trees, the workers shall wear the proper personal protective equipment including protective shoes, goggles, gloves, safety helmet with chin-strap, reflective vest, and safety harness.\n- A temporary working area will be cordoned off and alert others and against the hazards of falling objects.\n- The tree will be felled piece by piece using rigging/ cherry picker/ working platform which will be started from tip of branch piece by piece until all branches removed. Then the trunk shall remove from top to the bottom also piece by piece above ground level.\n- The tree workers will get to the crown of the slope trees by tree climbing if necessary, depending on site constraint shall also consider the risk of electrocution, especially if branches being fell off to the overhead line. This might cause serious injury to the staff and any workers nearby. The tree workers who climb the tree should be qualified tree worker. Starting the tree felling, the worker will cut the crown pieces by pieces with poles saws or chainsaws after holding the branches firmly by min.12mm rope to ground or any suitable rigging points.\n- In general, for branches with Diameter at breast height (DBH) between 100mm to 300mm, maximum length of each piece should be 5 m. For branches with DBH 300mm, maximum length of each piece should be 2m. However, the dimension of the cut pieces could be adjusted based on the on-site situation including target availability, slope gradient and the presence of buffers, for example, for the trees adjacent to public road, maximum size of cut piece should limit to 1.5m in length to reduce risk. For higher target availability, the cut branches will be lifted by min.12mm rope to the ground safely so that the lowering of cut limbs and stumps to avoid causing injury to person and damage to property. After the cutting of branches, the main trunk will be held firmly by the min.12mm ropes to limit its movement. Then the trunk will be cut at trunk base. Then the trunk will be laid onto the ground by the min.12mm ropes and will be cut into pieces that can be removed by the grab lorry from the site.\n- There might be some minor adjustment of the felling procedure in account of the onsite situation, with the same safety manner.\n- Tree trunks and branches shall be removed in pieces for reasons of safety and to such a manner that any potential damage to the public and adjacent railway utilities, services or pipes, structures, slopes or stream course vegetation is avoided. Care should be taken to avoid damaging such facilities.\n- Other existing trees to be retained adjacent to the trees to be felled shall be maintained properly, care should be taken to avoid damaging any structures or neighbouring trees, stubs, grass or surfaces.\n\n#### 6.3.2 Sequence Of Tree Felling Works (Scenario 2)\n\n- Position the mobile crane and aluminium foldable mobile tower on ground at optimum distance from tree to be felled.\n- Fence off the tree felling work area before operation.\n- Securely tie the chain saw to the man cage of aluminium foldable mobile tower or aerial working platform to avoid chain saw falling.\n- Tagline should be fastened to the tree branch which will be cut.\n- The cutting shall be started from the tallest branches to the lower branches.\n- Fasten and tie one end of the tree branch to be felled with min.12mm heavy-duty rope by the skilled workmen in the man cage and the other end of the min.12mm rope to be attached to the crane's b in order to control the felling down position of the tree branch.\n- Cut the bottom of the tree branch with the chain saw at about 1 inch depth.\n- The cut section of branch / truck shall be slowly brought down and directed to a safe location within the work area. The cutting length for all diameter of trunk shall be 500mm with safe working load 1 ton.\n- The stump shall be removed by hand grubbing and winching; stump cutting machine: hydraulic lifting or other method approved by the Engineer.\n- The felled tree branches and trunk shall be cut into pieces and removed offsite at the end of each working day to our nursery for mulching or compost.\n\n#### 6.3.3 Rigging System\n\n- Rigging system shall be used to control the falling zone of the tree branches during removing the trees located near the road or foot path.\n\n### 6.4 Tree To Be Retained\n\n- The tree will be fenced Temporary Protective Fencing shall be 1200m high comprising straining corner posts, intermediate straining posts, and bamboo pales.\n- End straining posts shall be 150x150x1800mm long timber posts driven 600mm into ground. Posts shall be installed at corners, ends of runs and at 10m centers.\n- Intermediate posts shall be 100x100x1800mm timber posts driven 600mm into ground at 2000 centers.\n- Bamboo pales shall be hand-driven from bamboo poles of approximately 30mm diameter. Pales shall be 1200mm long and notched 80mm from the top. Pales shall be positioned at not more than 50mm spacing.\n- Line wires shall consist of two numbers of 2mm diameter galvanized steel wires twisted together. Pales shall be fixed between the twisted wires. A first line wire shall be fixed 150mm from the top of the pales and second line wire shall be fixed 200mm from the ground level. A third line wire shall be fixed equally spaced between the other two. Fixing to intermediate timber posts shall be galvanized steel staples. Wires shall be fixed to end posts by running two complete turns round the post with the wire twisted back on itself and staples driven tightly into the post.\n- All protected trees to be watered twice a week around tree base.\n- Oil, petrol, creosote and other toxic chemicals must be kept away from the root spread.\n- Site fires must be kept well away from the trees and roots. Hot air and fumes will also cause damage.\n- If existing hard pavement around a tree is to be removed which exposes tree roots, pavement must be replaced immediately with top soil or sand to prevent surface roots from drying out.\n- Care must be taken to protect the trees from any physical damages during the erection and dismantling of scaffolding and temporary works.\n- Any cuts incurred shall be dressed immediately according to acceptable horticultural practice.\n- Extra care should be given to the tree within close distance of any possible excavation area; no form of root pruning is allowed unless requested and approved by Landscape Architect and Architect.\n- Acidic fluid or any other chemical waste the works to be used for shall not be allowed to be splashed onto any part of the trees or drained to the pit of the tree.\n\n### 6.5 Tree To Be Transplanted\n\n- Trees to be transplanted were marked with labels which are shown in Construction Drawing.\n- Except those trees required to house in the temporary nursery, that have been dug for transplanting should be planted as soon as possible.\n- Cover a root ball with damp material which will retain moisture (burlap, peat moss, etc.).\n- Pre-water holes before planting in dry soils. This prevents initial post-planting water from migrating away from the root ball.\n- The rootball for transplanting and pruning of the tree roots shall be conducted.\n- Using 8 to 10 times the DBH (diameter of the tree trunk measured at 1.3m from soil level of adjacent ground) or at most 2.5m (due to the logistic limit for trees transporting the truck) as diameter, mark out a circle on the around the tree as a guide to indicate the diameter of the root-ball to be provided for the tree. A wider rootball that can be handled conveniently shall allow the tree a better chance of surviving the transplanting.\n- Using a sharp spade drive the blade to full depth around the circumference of the circle in only two opposing segments, to sever the roots along the section to a depth of approximately 2 spits deep.\n- After certain regeneration period, repeat the above mentioned step for the next two opposite segments.\n- After a period since the last root pruning, prepare the root ball as specified and cut the underside of the root ball at 1.2m from soil level of adjacent ground. followed by uplifting and transplanting.\n- The tree shall be fully supported by guy wires and/or steel members, in accordance with the size of the tree, at all times.\n- Crown thinning will not be considered to be carried out to all transplanted trees except the trees subject to the limitation of the logistic arrangement. Crown thinning will be carried out at the same time when root pruning is conducted to reduce water consumption by the tree. In total no more than 20% of the crown shall be pruned and the crown shall be maintained in well-balanced form. The following key procedures shall be observed:\n  - Safety precautions shall be taken to protect those engaged in the operations, and people and properties in the vicinity.\n  - The tool for the pruning works shall be sharp to ensure clean cuts.\n  - The central main leader of the tree shall not be pruned. (no topping)\n  - Generally, pruning cuts should be made just outside the branch collar as Figure 3. The branch collar contains trunk or parent branch tissue and should not be damaged or removed. If the trunk collar has grown out on a dead limb to be removed the cut will be made just beyond the collar, without cutting the collar.\n  - When the tree is ready to be transplanted upon completion of root and crown pruning, the spreading branches shall be tied to protect the branches from tearing when lifting and transporting the tree.\n  - Cut around the circumference of the root zone around the tree to ensure all protruding roots are severed.\n  - Any loose soil around the shoulder of the outline for the rootball shall be eased off.\n  - Use the spade to cut off the rest of the roots from the rootball that was not cut previously and then thrust the spade underneath the rootball at an angle of 45 degrees to cut off to prevent damage during lifting and transiting.\n- The tree shall be tied from at least 2 points to be lifted from the ground and carefully loaded onto a truck.\n- The above mentioned preparation works are for trees up to semi-mature size trees. For mature and older trees the rootball shall be protected by a wooden container.\n- Upon lifting from the ground and during transit the tree shall be protected against excessive sunlight, wind and drought.

Responsibilities for Activities described within Method Statement\nCSHK is responsible to inspect and carry out the construction works. The following persons, as listed in the table below, will attend the specific tool-box talk and be responsible for the activities:\n\n| Company | Name | Position |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| CSHK | Vincent Li | Construction Manager |\n| CSHK | Nana Chung | Assistant Construction Manager |\n| CSHK | Ng Chun Wah | Assistant Section Agent |\n| CSHK | David Lam | Senior Engineer |\n| CSHK | Johnson Chung | Senior Engineer |\n| CSHK | Sam Tsang | Engineer |\n| CSHK | Edmond Man | Engineer |\n| CSHK | Jacky Luo | Engineer |\n| CSHK | Kingsley Zhao | Assistant Engineer |\n| CSHK | Li Man Hin | Graduate Engineer |\n| CSHK | Cheung Siu Kei | Superintendent (WPIC) |\n| CSHK | Benny Yeung | General Foreman |\n| CSHK | Jacky To | Foreman |\n| CSHK | TBC | CP(T) |\n\nAll workers carried out on the railway are supervised by a Contractor’s safety supervisor who has been qualified as a Competent Person (Track) [CP(T)] or a Competent Person (Non-Track) [CP(NT)]. Works are arranged so that the works are supervised at a minimum ratio of 1 CP(T)/CP(NT) to no more than 20 numbers of workers. All works carried out will be supervised by CSHK's WPIC.\n\n## 5. Programme and Working Hours (Start & finish date of operation/works)\nThe temporary water supply installation is general located at the CAs, therefore no RSI training is required. For installation work at the west depot entry track, it shall be carried out during non-peak hours (NPH from 11:00am to 15:00pm or night time after the train services at non-traffic hour (NTH: from 2:00am to 4:00am).\n\nFor test track, only 3 nos. of night time possessions are tentatively available on Fri^Sat, Sat^Sun, and one other night during the weekday. For Bifurcation area, installation work shall be carried out during NTH (2:00am to 4:00am) and 3 times a week as pre contract requirement.\n\n## 6. Plant, Equipment & Material (Identify type, model and specification of MAJOR plant & equipment)\nAll plants and equipment will be inspected prior to the mobilization on site to ensure that they are in good working condition and comply with the current regulations. The major plants and equipment will be deployed to carry out the works are as follow:\n\n| Plant / Equipment | Quantity |\n| --- | --- |\n| Water Tank | 2 |\n| Water Trunk | 2 |\n| Backhoe | 1 |\n\nActual plants and equipment to be used will be subject to site condition.\n\n## 7. Construction Methods / Construction Sequence Drawings\n1. Logistics Arrangement: Plant, Labour and Material\n    1.1 Access to Works Area W2, W3, W7, W11 & W12 (W4,W6 at separated connection point)\n    According to BUGN2023/21, once works areas declared as Construction Areas (CAs), RSI training and EDOC are not required, but for works less than 10m measuring from nearest rail, EDOC and CP(T) supervision is required. Initially, when the vehicular access bridge is not ready for delivery, we would temporarily utilize west gate via the west level crossing to deliver the plant and material. During delivery from West gate, escort vehicle with CPs would be deployed to escort the construction vehicles. CP(T) would be stationed at the West level crossing to check the vehicular height and direct the traffic and communicate with the yard master continuously. Apart from the construction vehicles, shuttle escorted by escort car will be arranged to directly carry worker from West Gate to the Container Village at W11 via the West level crossing.\n\nContractors would utilize the East gate once the vehicular access bridge is ready to use. Safety procedure similar to West Gate would be deployed. Details arrangement shall refer to security and traffic management under separate submission.\n\nNonetheless, we would hold regular workshops with RP/Yard master to go through current works within all CAs in order to identify and review any impact upon railway and/or depot operation. The rules and procedures for Railway Protection under the Railway Ordinance will be in accordance with Practice Note for Authorized Persons, Registered Structural Engineers and Registered Geotechnical Engineers (PNAP ADV-33 / APP-24). Details traffic and security arrangement shall refer to separate submission.\n\n    1.2 Access to Works Area W1\n    For the OYB-South bifurcation, both labour and plants would be delivered via temporary access Gate at slip road underneath Shun Long Road to W1. (Details refer to traffic and security management plan under separate submission). To avoid vehicle, damage the existing RP Fence, water-filled barrier will be installed approximately 1m away from the fence as crushing barrier.\n\n2. Arrangement of Temporary Water Supply at Siu Ho Wan Depot\nThere is one 700mm dia. government fresh water main on the western side of the site (generally referring to Figure 1.1), and one 200mm dia. water connection will be provided for us to use for subsequent pipework of temporary water supply. Connection work and pipework for provision of temp. water supply arrangement would just be carried out after CA declarations. While for OAs, all workers should have qualification of RSI. Before commencement of any task, working hours and arrangement would be reported to Yard Master and should follow the work flow of ETMS. In addition, processes of the task should be supervised by CP(T) all the times.\n\n    2.1 Temporary Water Supply (Stage 1)\n    Before completion of the said pipework/watermain diversion for bifurcation, temporary water will be proposed to source from existing water main on the South Road at Siu Ho Wan Depot, and we shall apply for the approval from Depot Yard Master to connect tee joints and water meters to Area W11 and W2 (detail as below, EDOC is required) in the purpose of construction. Meanwhile, this issue would be further coordinated with MTR CWBU and Depot in due course.\n\n    2.2 Temporary Water Supply to Various Construction Works Area (Stage 2)\n    Discharging water from Tai Ho Interchange (THI) and installing tee joints are here considered as applicable measures to achieve temporary water supply on Stage 2. Firstly, Form WWO 542 with a plan showing the proposed location and size of the pipeworks at the boundary of the work site shall be submitted to WSD. Then, connection work will be carried out by a licensed plumber after receiving approval by the Water Authority. After this, we will connect 100mm diameter pipe to the WSD water supply connection point to fit our follow-up work for extension of water pipe (sapphire dotted line) to each Works Area. Overall arrangement is shown in Figure 1.3. The detail of the tee joint can refer to Figure 1.4.\n\n    Besides, water pipes shall be laid next to the edges of road kerbs to minimize the impact to traffic.\n\n    2.2.1 Area W12, W3 & W7\n    100mm dia. PE water pipe shall be used for provision in W12, and 50mm dia. PE water pipe will be used in W3 and W7. Temporary Water Supply Routing Layout (Stage 2) refers to Figure 1.6. In addition, to provide accessible road, approximate 200mm deep cover recess (red dotted circle illustrated in Figure 1.6) should be provided to hide water pipe when the pipe crosses the road transversely. Detail of recess is showing in Figure 1.5.\n\n    Work for recess with pipe should be carried out as following steps:\n    a. Using floor saw/hand held saw to cut through an approximate 150mm-wide area on the concrete hard pavement;\n    b. Break up concrete hard pavement by backhoe and clear away concrete fragments;\n    c. Lay water pipe onto the recess;\n    d. Backfill subbase to the road level to cover the water pipe and place one piece of 60mm thk. steel plate.\n\n    Considering to maintain vehicular access, captioned recess with pipework is just carried out to one lane of the road first, then turns to another lane.\n\n    Additionally, as the Tee off to PMO (site office), the swabbing & sampling will be carried out for W7 before the usage of portable water (under separate submission).\n\n    2.2.2 Area W11 & W2\n    After the main water supply point is ready for connection from THI, water pipe reaching test track is required to cross the railway track via the west level crossing to supply water for W11 and W2 (routing refers to Figure 1.6). 100mm dia. PE pipe shall be used.\n\n    For water pipe crossing the test tracks/level crossing, one 150mm PVC sleeve pipe is embedded in the ballast (parallel to the sleepers), and then the 100mm dia. PE pipe shall be laid inside the PVC pipe. Details of level-crossing pipe may refer to Figure 1.7. Install one water tee joint with one valve gate to the main 100mm dia. PE water pipe every 50m.\n\n    2.2.3 Area W1\n    For Works Area W1, the total area is approximately 700㎡. Water pipes would be connected from Tai Ho interchange via 75mm dia. PE pipe for upcoming pre-drilling works. The alignment of pipeline is proposed to be placed inside surface channel to W1. We will coordinate with C7 contractor for the temporary water pipe routing of THI.\n\n    2.2.4 Area W4, W5 & W6A & W6B\n    Temporary water will be given from nearby existing water mains at Siu Ho Wan Depot, and we shall apply for the approval from Depot Yard Master to connect tee joints to discharge water to Area W4, W5 & W6B. Further coordination will be carried out with Depot in due course. And method statement will be submitted separately.\n\n3. Hand over the water meter from other contractor to 1701\nArrange a site inspection for the water meter hand over from 1732 to 1701 (first batch Layout plan attached in Appendix C). Record the current reading of the water meter in the form of a photograph. The meter readings will be submitted to MTRC every month.\n\n4. Installation a new water meter at W3B, AB16, South Road (Near Grid 68)\n    1. Determine which pipe is used for floor washing,\n    2. Turn off the existing gate valve and remove the air valve,\n    3. Install the new gate valve and the suitable water meter,\n    4. Install the old air valve, step 2, 3 & 4 to be carried out by licensed plumber,\n    5. Record the current reading of the water meter in the form of a photograph,\n    6. The meter readings will be submitted to MTRC every month.\n\n## 8. Safety (Risk Assessments)\nRisk Assessment attached in Appendix A has been prepared for all general activities.

Works Methodology\n\n### 6.1 Preparation Works\n\nTrees to be felled were marked with label. Contractor shall only fell those trees shown as Appendix A. Before the tree felling, the trees will be cordoned off by temporary fence to fence off the operation area and other people from their falling zone. The cordoned off area should be as far as practicable, based on on-site situation. The worker holds relevant certificates (Chainsaw Safety Pruning, Tree Climbing, etc). All certificates and documents of equipment required shall be checked on site. Pre-work Briefing or training shall be provided to workers by frontline supervisors daily. Non-transparent plastic panels shall be provided at adequate distance around the tree to be felled. \"Lookout man\" shall be provided to standby outside the tree felling works area during the whole operation to keep anyone from not entering the workplace. Outmost care shall be taken into consideration during the felling works to avoid adjacent existing properties and plants to be retained/ transplanted from any damages. All worker for tree felling works shall wear their personal protective equipment, such as safety belt and helmet, at all times of the works. Protection from damage of existing underground utilities shall be completed commencement of the tree felling works. An escape route shall be established. A path of escape from the work area shall be determined for the chain saw operator to use after the felling cuts are made and the tree begins to fall. An ideal escape route should be at a 45-degree angle from the tree's direction of fall.\n\nThe escape route shall be cleared of any brush or ground debris, including any equipment. The minimum retreat distance shall be 6 meters.\n\nA least 2 ground operators shall manage pedestrian safety at 2 ends of the works area during the whole operation.\n\nTTA will be provide if necessary.\n\n### 6.2 Tree Felling\n\n#### 6.2.1 Sequence of Tree Felling Works by Climbing (Scenario 1)\n\nTree Felling will comply with the standard of American National. Standard for Arboricultural Operations (ANSI Z133) - Safety Requirements.\n\nBefore starting any tree felling work, the supervisor will coordinate with site representative to ensure that no trees are felled wrongly. All trees to be felled shall be confirmed ad double checked by the Supervisor.\n\nCherry picker/working platform/ crane lorry will be used, if necessary, to facilitate the removal of tree by pieces and it will be temporarily parked inside the site only. During the working at height on the trees, the workers shall wear the proper personal protective equipment including protective shoes, goggles, gloves, safety helmet with chin-strap, reflective vest, and safety harness.\n\nThe worker should wear a safety harness with the secured self-retracting lifelines (sala block system attached at the anchor point of Cherry picker Cherry picker/ working platform/ crane lorry). Anchor points must always be attached above the head.\n\nA temporary working area will be cordoned off and alert others and against the hazards of falling objects.\n\nThe tree will be felled piece by piece using rigging/ cherry picker/ working platform which will be started from tip of branch piece by piece until all branches removed. Then the trunk shall remove from top to the bottom also piece by piece above ground level.\n\nThe tree workers will get to the crown of the slope trees by tree climbing if necessary, depending on site constraint shall also consider the risk of electrocution, especially if branches being fell off to the overhead line. This might cause serious injury to the staff and any workers nearby. The tree workers who climb the tree should be qualified tree worker. Starting the tree felling, the worker will cut the crown pieces by pieces with poles saws or chainsaws after holding the branches firmly by min.12mm rope to ground or any suitable rigging points.\n\nIn general, for branches with Diameter at breast height (DBH) between 100mm to 300mm, maximum length of each piece should be 5 m. For branches with DBH 300mm, maximum length of each piece should be 2m. However, the dimension of the cut pieces could be adjusted based on the on-site situation including target availability, slope gradient and the presence of buffers, for example, for the trees adjacent to public road, maximum size of cut piece should limit to 1.5m in length to reduce risk. For higher target availability, the cut branches will be lifted by min.12mm rope to the ground safely so that the lowering of cut limbs and stumps to avoid causing injury to person and damage to property. After the cutting of branches, the main trunk will be held firmly by the min.12mm ropes to limit its movement. Then the trunk will be cut at trunk base. Then the trunk will be laid onto the ground by the min.12mm ropes and will be cut into pieces that can be removed by the grab lorry from the site.\n\nThere might be some minor adjustment of the felling procedure in account of the on-site situation, with the same safety manner.\n\nTree trunks and branches shall be removed in pieces for reasons of safety and to such a manner that any potential damage to the public and adjacent railway utilities, services or pipes, structures, slopes or stream course vegetation is avoided. Care should be taken to avoid damaging such facilities.\n\nOther existing trees to be retained adjacent to the trees to be felled shall be maintained properly, care should be taken to avoid damaging any structures or neighbouring trees, stubs, grass or surfaces.\n\n#### 6.2.2 Sequence of Tree Felling Works (Scenario 2)\n\nPosition the mobile crane and aluminium foldable mobile tower on ground at optimum distance from tree to be felled.\n\nFence off the tree felling work area before operation.\n\nSecurely tie the chain saw to the man cage of aluminium foldable mobile tower or aerial working platform to avoid chain saw falling.\n\nTagline should be fastened to the tree branch which will be cut.\n\nThe cutting shall be started from the tallest branches to the lower branches.\n\nFasten and tie one end of the tree branch to be felled with min.12mm heavy-duty rope by the skilled workmen in the man cage and the other end of the min.12mm rope to be attached to the crane's b in order to control the felling down position of the tree branch.\n\nCut the bottom of the tree branch with the chain saw at about 1 inch depth.\n\nThe cut section of branch / truck shall be slowly brought down and directed to a safe location within the work area. The cutting length for all diameter of trunk shall be 500mm with safe working load 1 ton.\n\nThe stump shall be removed by hand grubbing and winching; stump cutting machine: hydraulic lifting or other method approved by the Engineer.\n\nThe felled tree branches and trunk shall be cut into pieces and removed offsite at the end of each working day to our nursery for mulching or compost.\n\n### 6.3 Rigging system\n\nRigging system shall be used to control the falling zone of the tree branches during removing the trees located near the road or foot path.\n\n## 7. Safety\n\nAll workers shall be equipped with reflective vests and safety helmets during operation. All workers must go through a briefing by the Construction Manager/ Engineer/ Safety Officer/Safety Supervisor before commencement of any works. A pre-meeting will be arranged before commencement of the work among Survey Team, Construction Team and Safety Team to brief the nature of works, the safety aspects and the necessary safety requirements as identified in the Risk Assessment in Appendix D.\n\nTo ensure the worker carrying out the tree felling works are fully informed of the risks and they are aware of the measures to control those risks, the Briefing will be provided before operation commence. Safety helmets fitted with chin straps must be worn within the site, safety boots, hearing protectors (if needed), high visibility jackets / sashes, reflective vests, goggles, gloves and full body harnesses for work at height will be provided to all staff working on site. Plastic barriers and reflective traffic cones will be prepared prior to work commencement to demarcate the working area. Permit-to-Dig system shall be implemented and strictly followed to mitigate the risk of damages to underground utilities. Relevant valid underground utilities plans shall be obtained and cable detection shall be conducted by competent person before commencement of works. Briefing shall be conducted to workers to acknowledge them on the underground utility conditions at the works area and precautions required. The proposed working area should be marked physically on site by CP. Any emergency situation shall be reported to site supervisors (i.e. Construction Manager/Engineer/ Foreman etc.) and Safety Department for prompt response. The emergency contact list is shown in Appendix D. The risk for the works shall be assessed and the Risk Assessment Analysis is shown in Appendix C.\n\n## 8. Environmental\n\nThe following mitigation measures will be followed:\n- General works shall be carried out during normal working hours (08:00 to 18:00).

The general working hours will be from 08:00-19:00 daily, from Monday to Saturday. CSHK would check internally to fulfil the Construction Noise Permit Requirement. As the hydrographic survey are mainly to be carried out outside depot, therefore no CP(T)/CP(NT) is needed during the approved working period.\n\n## 6. **Plant, Equipment & Material**\n\nAll plants and equipment will be inspected prior to the mobilization on site to ensure that they are in good working condition and comply with the current regulations. The major plants and equipment will be deployed to carry out the works are as follow:\n\n### 6.1 Survey Vessel\n\nA survey vessel will be equipped with a single-beam echo sounder and computer with logging software. The transducer will be mounted on a side of the vessel. An electric-power-generator/uninterruptible power source (UPS battery) is required in order to provide the power to the above hardware.\n\n### 6.2 Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS)\n\nDevice Name: Trimble DGPS Receiver SPS356. Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) is recommended for positioning of the sailing vessel. The differential signal broadcasts at Kau Yi Chau will be integrated with the GPS data in the device to provide a real-time positioning coordinates, and the coordinates will be transformed into the Hong Kong 1980 Coordinates System. With reference to the brochure of the DGPS, the differential position accuracy is about 1m.\n\n### 6.3 Echo-sounder\n\nDevice Name: Echotrac MK III. Bathymetric data will be collected by the echo sounder with a narrow beam transducer. The performance had been maintained at 0.01m +/-0.1% of depth @200kHz total depth of which depends on the accuracy of sound velocity input. The output of echo sounder had been the depth of seabed. Depth had been logged to the computer devices.\n\n### 6.4 Software\n\nHYPACK will be used for integrating survey equipments, capturing survey data and data reduction.\n\n### 6.5 Computer\n\nA desktop/laptop computer with recommended specification of the software will be used to run the software during the survey.\n\n### 6.6 Government Tide Database\n\nGovernment closest tide station's data would be used for tide reading. The closest tide station is at Chek Lap Kok.\n\n### 6.7 Bar Check Plate and Chain\n\nThe Bar Check plate is around 600mm in diameter and 3-5 mm thick with 5x100mm diameter hole evenly distributed on the plate. The bar check should be around 5kg in weight. The interval starts from the top of the plate. Every one meter there would be a marker on the chain.\n\n## 7. **Preparation of Survey**\n\n### 7.1 Survey Area\n\nThe hydrographic survey boundary is provided from client's information. Below is the approximated survey boundary.\n\n### 7.2 Proposed schedule of record survey\n\nThe field survey is proposed to be last for 1 working day. The subject site should be clear without blocking during the field survey. The working Permit will be also applied from Marine Department before survey if it is needed. CSHK will liaise and seek approval from HKTS/depot/C7. CSHK will check the exact date of survey works with HKTS and depot to ensure that no operations need of the barging point on that date.\n\n## 8. **Survey Methods**\n\n### 8.1 Calibration of Equipment\n\n#### 8.1.1 Instruments\n\nAll instruments shall be calibrated by equipment certificating company once a year. Certificate will then be issued after calibration to ensure all instrument are in good condition, Instrument without calibration certificate or with expired certificate are not allowed to use within the site area and will be labelled. Calibration certificate is attached.\n\n#### 8.1.2 DGPS\n\nDGPS will be calibrated by setting it on known control station prior and after the sounding operation. The DGPS receiver will be mounted well. Satellite signal will be logged and computed for positioning comparison. If the position logged by the DGPS is within tolerance (+/-1m) of the coordinates of control station, the calibration is acceptable.\n\n#### 8.1.3 Bar Check Method\n\nBar check test will be followed to determine the correctness for the echo sounding equipment. A steel plate will be lowered underneath the transducer. The chain linked to the steel plate shall be marked with 1m interval. At the beginning, the plate will be lowered to 2m depth, to calibrate the draft of the transducer. The steel plate then will be lowered to the deepest section to be surveyed. Before the bar check, the sound velocity will be adjusted to eliminate the difference between reading and the depth of steel plate. After that, the steel plate will be raised meter by meter and the reading recorded on echo roll paper will also be checked for any discrepancy. Re-adjustment of sound velocity and calibration is necessary if the reading is different from the pre-determined depth.\n\n### 8.1.4 HDOP of Satellites\n\nThe value of HDOP, horizontal dilution of precision, is indicating the positional precision. The meaning of HDOP value is as shown below:\n\n| HDOP Value | Rating    | Description                                                                                   |\n|------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| <1         | Ideal     | Highest possible confidence level to be used for applications demanding the highest possible precision at all times. |\n| 1-2        | Excellent | At this confidence level, positional measurements are considered accurate enough to meet all but the most sensitive applications. |\n| 2-5        | Good      | Represents a level that marks the minimum appropriate for making business decisions. Positional measurements could be used to make reliable in-route navigation suggestions to the user. |\n| 5-10       | Moderate  | Positional measurements could be used for calculations, but the fix quality could still be improved. A more open view of the sky is recommended. |\n| 10-20      | Fair      | Represents a low confidence level. Positional measurements should be discarded or used only to indicate a very rough estimate of the current location. |\n| >20        | Poor      | At this level, measurements are inaccurate by as much as 300 meters with a 6-meter accurate device (50 DOP x 6 meters) and should be discarded. |\n\nThe value of HDOP of satellites received during the survey will be monitored and recorded.\n\n## 8.2 Preparation of Plan lines\n\nPre-assigned survey lines will be allocated to cover the entire sounding portion. The principle of designing the survey lines would either be 5m section intervals normal to the base line or 5m fixed intervals. In addition, reasonable check lines shall be performed normal to the survey line. The interval of check line usually adopted as 40m or minimal of 2-3 check lines to be adopted.\n\n## 8.3 Field Survey\n\nSurvey vessel speed will be kept in a constant speed, generally 3-5 knots will be applied which causing no intolerable distortion to the sounding records. The software will be set to mark on the data file and sounding paper in every 5m. The interval will be set in distance instead of time because the sampling rate by time had been affected by speed of the boat. The marks would be evenly distributed along the cross section if marks were taken by distance intervals. The sounding will be recorded in the computer by 0.1s intervals; it means 0.15m intervals at speed of 3 knot. A minimum of 2-3 check lines should be run for ensure the quality of the sounding data.\n\n## 8.4 Tide Reading\n\nThe closest government tide gauge Chek Lap Kok will be constantly booked during the period of the survey with readings being taken in 10 minutes interval throughout that period.\n\n## 8.5 Data reduction\n\n### 8.5.1 Data reduction and Editing\n\nHYPACK software will be used for reducing the raw data. The corrections, such as tide, will be applied to the raw data and reduced to Hong Kong Principal Datum (H.K.P.D.). After applying the corrections, the noise, such as bubbles, fishes, unpredictable errors, will be removed. Then, the data will be reduced into point-form and the outliers will be removed by comparing the data in different survey-lines.\n\n### 8.5.2 Sorting\n\nAfter the data editing, the shallowest depth points will be selected, for the scale of 1:500 using A2 paper, in their true position soundings' cell size would be $D_X = 2$ $D_Y = 1$. The processing data sign should be positive within Hypack program.\n\n## 8.5.3 Deliverables\n\nList of common deliverables of sounding surveys for charting and engineering purposes:\n- (a) Sounding data (i.e. Northing, Easting and Depth) in ASCII format;\n- (b) Raw sounding data of time, position and depth in format readable by the common hydrographic survey packages;\n- (c) Hard copy and softcopy of sounding plan, cross-section plan and track plot of actual runlines.\n\n## 9. **Safety**\n\n### 9.1 General Safety\n\nAll workers shall be equipped with life jackets and safety helmets during operation.

For the arrangement of seawall and the barging point in Siu Ho Wan Depot, please refer to separate submission 1701/W/000/CSC/760/000204 Method Statement for Seawall Arrangement.\n\n#### 7.2.2 Classification\n\nFor the classification of C&D Materials, please refer to separate submission 1701/W/000/CSC/790/000029 Spoil Disposal Plan.\n\n#### 7.2.3 Sorting of C&D Materials\n\nFor sorting of C&D Materials, please refer to separate submission 1701/W/000/CSC/790/000029 Spoil Disposal Plan.\n\n#### 7.2.4 Forecast of C&D Materials\n\nFor forecast of C&D Materials, please refer to separate submission 1701/W/000/CSC/790/000029 Spoil Disposal Plan.\n\n#### 7.2.5 Construction Waste Disposal Charging Scheme\n\nCSHK have applied to EPD for a billing account and obtain chits for the disposal of C&D non-inert waste to landfill sites in WENT and inert materials at the TM 38 Public Fill Reception Facility. The CHIT example is shown in Figure 1.\n\nA trip-ticket system (TTS) will be implemented to manage and record the removal of C&D material generated from the construction work on Contract 1701.\n\nA Disposal Delivery Form and related Daily Record Summary for Disposal of C&D materials from site will be used to manage our C&D material disposal process. The trip tickets will record specific designated disposal grounds.\n\nCSHK will inform the Project Manager's Representative in advance for removal of C&D materials.\n\nThe Project Manager's Representative will check each truckload of C&D materials/waste leaving the site and the representative will complete and stamp the Disposal Delivery Form (DDF) (as attached in Appendix).\n\nThe dump truck will proceed to the disposal ground as stipulated in the DDF. In the event that the disposal ground is the Barging Facility or other approved designated disposal ground, the truck driver will present the DDF to the facility operator. If the spoil disposal material complies with the acceptance criteria, disposal of the materials will be permitted and the facility operator will return the truck driver a transaction receipt and stamp the DDF.\n\nCSHK will maintain a daily record of the disposal of C&D material from the site which will include details of the materials, the truck number, departure time, etc, using the summary record of trip ticket system. The copy of the daily record will be forwarded to depot for reference and retention.\n\nCSHK will update the summary record of trip ticket system on a daily basis or whenever there is a return of transaction records from the truck drivers. The record will be readily available for checking by the Project Director's Representative and will be submitted formally to the Project Manager's Representative on a monthly basis as part of the monthly update of the Environmental Management Plan.\n\nFor disposal at PFRF or Landfill, CSHK will check on a regular and routine basis the information in the summary record of trip ticket system against the disposal records of C&D materials from EPD's website. The quality and environmental manager will arrange internal audits to track internal movements of materials and ensure no irregular disposal occurs.\n\nIn the event a trip ticket process irregularity is detected CSHK will submit to MTRCL, within five working days, the supporting stamped DDF and the transaction receipts to confirm proper completion of the delivery trips.\n\n#### 7.2.7 Dump Truck Tracking System\n\nEvery dump truck, delivery barge or hopper barge used for disposal of C&D materials must equip with a Global Positioning System. For Dump Truck Tracking System or Global Positioning System (GPS), please refer to the separate submission 1701/W/000/CSC/510/000013 Real Time Tracking and Monitoring System for Dump Trucks and 1701/W/000/CSC/790/000029 Spoil Disposal Plan.\n\n#### 7.2.8 Dumping License\n\nAll dump truck drivers should apply for a valid dumping license from the Fill Management Division, CEDD, to dump public fill within the CEDD public fill reception facilities if required.\n\n#### 7.2.9 Mechanical Covers\n\nAll vehicles transporting spoil from the site for disposal have their loads fully covered with a mechanical cover to prevent spillage of spoil on the roads. For mechanical cover requirements, please refer to separate submission 1701/W/000/CSC/790/000029 Spoil Disposal Plan.\n\n#### 7.2.10 Temporary Storage Area for C&D Materials\n\nThere will be two 20m x 20m temporary storage areas in W11. One will be storing C&D materials, the other one will be storing marine sediments. In the C&D material temporary storage area, there will be a portion of the space used to store non-inert C&D materials. Each storage area can store at least 1000 tons of materials. The layout plan will be shown in the following figure. WPIC from CSHK will check the temporary storage areas regularly to ensure that no flammable materials would be stored in the area.\n\n#### Figure.2 – Temporary storage area layout plan\n\n### 7.3 Management of Disposal of Marine Sediment\n\nThe Type 1 (Open Sea Disposal) sediment generated would be reused on site (e.g. as backfilling materials) as far as possible after on-site treatment. The remaining Type 1 (Open Sea Disposal) sediment after onsite reuse as well as other types of sediment would be disposed to marine disposal sites according to Marine Fill Committee (MFC). Marine sediment will be disposed of to open sea disposal for Type1 Sediment, as directed by MFC.\n\n#### 7.3.1 Marine Dumping permit Application\n\nTo avoid and minimize the impacts arising from the marine sediments, CSHK will apply for the marine dumping permit under Dumping at Sea Ordinance (DASO) from EPD for the sediment disposal. The updated permits will be placed on board for readily inspection.\n\nAll Marine Sediment will be transported and dumped at the designed dumping grounds as specified in the dumping permit. The uncontaminated marine sediments containing Category L will be deposited of at Type 1 — Open Sea disposal area allocated by the Marine Fill Committee. The removed contaminated marine sediments containing Category M sediments both passing and failing biological tests and Category H sediment passing biological tests as designed in ETWBTC(W) 34.2002 will be disposed of at Type 2- Confined Marine Disposal Area allocated by the Marine Fill Committee.\n\nThe hopper barge for transporting the excavated sediment to the specified marine dumping site will be fitted with tight fitting seal to their bottom openings to prevent leakage of sediment and equipped with a front-end module unit for Real time Tracking & Monitoring of Vessel (RTTMV) to prevent any illegal dumping. No double handling of the excavated sediment would be performed after the hopper barge leaving the barging point and therefore the excavated sediment shall not be loaded into other vessels for whatever purpose.\n\nThe hopper barge collected the excavated sediment from the barging point, with a copy of the valid dumping permit on board, will be towed by tug boats to the specified marine dumping site. Before the loaded hopper barge leaves the barging point to the specified marine dumping site, a notification of dumping will be provided to the Management Team of specified marine dumping site, as required by the CEDD.\n\nOn arrival of the specified marine dumping site, the hopper barge operator will report to the control office of the Management Team of the specified marine dumping site. The hopper barge operator will then follow the instruction given by the Management Team staff and manoeuvre the hopper barge into the specified marine dumping site. Dumping will be commenced by an area as directed by the Management Team and proceeded slowly and steadily.\n\nThe bottom opening of hopper barge will be closed immediately after dumping, and will be kept closed during its return journey. After the completion of the sediment discharging, the hopper barge operator will inform the control office of Management Team before leaving the specified marine dumping site.\n\n#### Table 4 – Disposal Spaces for Types of Sediments\n\n| Disposal Type                | Category of Sediments | In-situ Volume of Sediment | Sediment Disposal Spaces                                                                                  |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Type 1-Open Sea Disposal     | Category L Sediments  | 10,741 m3                  | The subarea “SHW Depot Phase 1 & Adv” within the South Cheung Chau Open Sea Sediment Disposal Area as shown on Drawing No. MFC/002-SHW Depot Phase 1 & Adv. |\n| Type 1-Open Sea Disposal (Dedicated Site) | Category Mp Sediments (i.e. Category M Sediments passing biological test) | 1,132 m3 | Subareas to be directed on site within the Mud Pit of the Confined Marine Sediment Disposal Facility to the East of Sha Chau. |\n| Type 2 –Confined Marine Disposal | Category H Sediments (i.e. Category H Sediments not requiring test) | 230 m3 | Subareas to be directed on site within the Mud Pit of the Confined Marine Sediment Disposal Facility at the East of Sha Chau. |\n\n### 7.3.3 Supervision and Record Keeping\n\nA full-time site supervisor will be assigned at the barging point to supervise the loading operation. All dumping operations will be supervised and recorded, at the loading points during the loading and at the specified dumping site during the discharging of sediment, so as to ensure the consistency and accuracy of the sediment dumping operation.\n\nA monthly return of sediment dumping records will be submitted, within the first week of each month, to the Engineer and the MFC, showing the number of the barge loads and estimated quantity of dumped material at the dumping site. A \"Nil\" return shall be provided even if no sediment dumping operation will carry out within any particular month.\n\n## 7.4 Disposal Plan for C&D Materials\n\nThe C&D materials will mainly be delivered from the Works Area W11 to the seawall through the Vehicular Access Bridge (VAB). For traffic routing from depot works area W11 to seawall, please refer to separate submission 1701/W/000/CSC/760/000204 Method Statement for Seawall Arrangement.\n\nThen, the materials will be transferred from the seawall to the barge. The barge leaves the Siu Ho Wan depot seawall and travels to the designated disposal area seawall. Lastly, the materials will be transferred from the designated disposal area seawall to the land access.\n\n### 7.4.1 From Depot to Seawall\n\nThe C&D materials will mainly be produced in W11. For traffic arrangements and traffic routing from depot works area W11 to seawall, please refer to separate submission 1701/W/000/CSC/760/000204 Method Statement for Seawall Arrangement.\n\nAll dump trucks or any construction vehicles will be clean and free from mud before accessing the Vehicular Access Bridge (VAB) in depot. A wheel washing facility near VAB will be provided by CSHK. All dump trucks will go through the wheel washing facility before entering the VAB. WPIC will check to ensure that the vehicle wheels are clean and free of mud and muddy water.\n\nCP escort will be required for all dump trucks travelling in OA areas, especially travelling to barging point via OA areas.\n\nCSHK will liaise with MTR depot about the procedures of opening the access gate at Seawall barging area before using the seawall.\n\n#### Automatic Wheel Washing Facility\n\nThe details of the Automatic Wheel Washing Facility are in Appendix. The location of the facility is shown in the below Figure. The exact location of the wheel washing facility will be subjected to the site condition.\n\n#### Figure.7.1 – Wheel washing facility layout plan\n\n### 7.4.2 From Seawall to Barge\n\nThe barging facility would be used for the disposal of C&D materials. A roro barge would work as the floating device such that the disposal trucks could drive on them to reach the hopper barge or delivery barge. The arrangement for loading the excavated materials is illustrated in Figure 7.1.\n\nCSHK will further liaise with depot and CEDD about the actual date of the C&D disposal and using the seawall. CSHK will treat the delivery of MTR trains and materials as first priority, to ensure that the delivery of MTR trains and materials using seawall will not be affected.\n\nAll barging operations will be curtailed if the visibility falls below 1.0 nautical mile, or Typhoon Signal No.3 or above or Black Rainstorm Warning is hoisted. All barges will go to the nearest typhoon shelter when typhoon signal No.3 or above is hoisted.\n\nThere will be a net provided at the sides of the tipping haul during the disposal process of C&D materials from the dump truck to the barges for dust mitigation purpose.\n\nC&D materials will be unloaded into an area of the hopper barge directly below the tipping hall. If there is a need to spread out the materials in the barge, CSHK will move the barge, such that any further C&D materials can be loaded into an empty area of the barge, or if there is plant or equipment on the barge, we will utilize it to spread out the materials without the need for the barge to reposition. Mitigation measures such as water spraying will be implemented to minimize dust emission.\n\nThere will be load lines at\n## 8. **Safety (Risk Assessments)**\n\n### 8.1 General Safety\n\n- All workers shall attend a site-specific induction course conducted by the Safety Team.

Any barge's representative not complying with this requirement will not be permitted to board/disembark from the Office Barge. Any non-compliance will be reported to the relevant Permit Holder and project management office.\n- All tug boats and barges will turn on their lights while working in the vicinity of the Mud Pits in dark or when visibility is poor.\n- Any barge while waiting in the vicinity of the Mud Pits to queue up for disposal, the barge will be served/looked after by a tug boat.\n- Life jackets and life saver rings will be placed near the bollards at the seawall during the works at seawall.\n\n### 8.3 Risk Assessment\n\nThe risk for the works shall be assessed and the Risk Assessment Analysis is shown in Appendix A.\n\n## 9. **Environmental**\n\n### Key Assumptions\n\n- No marine works (e.g., dredging of sediment, modification of existing seawall, etc.) would be required.\n- Dry goods, steel, rebar, spoils, machineries, DfMA, and MiC structural elements would be unloaded via barges.\n- Average 6 trips per day and 7 days per week (i.e., 42 trips per week) would be utilized between Year 2024 and Year 2027 for depot construction.\n- Spoils will be loaded onto dump trucks within the main construction site. The dump trucks will travel to the vertical seawall and directly onto barges before unloading into the barge. Good site practices and control measures described below would be undertaken.\n- There would be no residential receivers in the vicinity during the temporary use of the existing vertical seawall.\n\n### General Mitigation Measures\n\n- General works shall be carried out during normal working hours (08:00 to 18:00). However, should the progress demand for the works to be undertaken from 19:00 to 07:00 the next day or on public holidays, a construction noise permit shall be obtained as necessary.\n- Plant with QPME label will be employed if available.\n- Only plant with NRMM label will be used unless exempted.\n- For disposal of C&D materials, water spray will be carried out during the work to prevent dust generation.\n- C&D material for disposal will be water sprayed to suppress dust.\n- Wheel-washing facilities should be provided at the exits from work areas. A hard-surfaced road between any washing facility and the public road should also be provided.\n- Regular watering of active works areas, exposed areas, and paved haul roads.\n- Drip trays should be provided to chemical waste containers. The drip tray should be cleaned up regularly. Clean up should be done before foreseeable inclement weather such as typhoon or heavy rain.\n- The works shall follow relevant mitigation measures as required under the Environmental Permit (EP)/EP submission and Contractor's Environmental Management Plan (EMP).\n\n### Mitigation Measures for Potential Ecological and Fisheries Impacts\n\nNo specific ecological mitigation measures are deemed necessary. However, it is essential to implement all necessary control measures to avoid and minimize any indirect impacts during the temporary utilization of the existing vertical seawall period. A summary of these control measures is given below.\n\n- The Contractor shall ensure the real-time GPS or equivalent system is installed and operating on all the barges during their services to record the marine travel routes and the relevant GPS data including justification and consideration for the use of the western marine route shall be sent to the Project Engineer/full-time Resident Site Staff (RSS) for daily review and ET/IEC will support on the project where necessary. The daily record of marine travel route will be reviewed, collected, and filed by the RSS for inspection and monitoring purposes.\n- ET and IEC will carry out sample checks of the GPS records regularly (e.g., at least once a month).\n- The Project Engineer/RSS would verify the GPS or equivalent data and identify any events when barges incidentally enter into Marine Parks, and instruct the Contractor to investigate and/or rectify such events as soon as practicable.\n- Relevant specification clauses related to the above tasks shall be included in the Tender Specification for implementation by the Contractor.\n- In case any barges incidentally enter into Marine Parks, the ET/Project Engineer/RSS shall instruct the barge operators to leave Marine Parks as soon as practicable. Nevertheless, the barges are subject to a speed limit of not more than 10 knots at any time inside Marine Park according to the Marine Parks and Marine Reserves Regulation (Cap. 476A). The tender document would also request the Contractor to comply with the statutory requirements.\n- The ET shall report any events when barges incidentally enter into Marine Parks in the EM&A report.\n\n### Mitigation Measures for Potential Water Quality Impacts\n\nAs the barging point is located near the Brothers Marine Park, the following good site practices should be implemented to minimize the potential water quality impact due to the usage of the barging point:\n\n- The wastewater should be collected within the site and would not discharge to the sea.\n- All vessels should be sized so that adequate clearance is maintained between vessels and the seabed in all tide conditions, to minimize that undue turbidity is not generated by turbulence from vessel movement or propeller wash.\n- Loading of barges should be controlled to prevent the splashing of material into the surrounding water.\n- Barges shall not be filled to a level which will cause overflow of materials or pollution of water during loading or transportation.\n- Excess materials shall be cleaned from the decks and exposed fittings of barges before the vessels are moved.\n- Adequate freeboard shall be maintained on barges to reduce the likelihood of decks being washed by wave action.\n\n### Mitigation Measures for Potential Air Quality Impacts\n\nAir Pollution Control (Construction Dust) Regulation and good site practice as follows:\n\n- Any excavated or stockpile of dusty material including those on barges should be covered entirely by impervious sheeting or sprayed with water to maintain the entire surface wet and then removed or backfilled or reinstated where practicable for the excavation or unloading.\n- Any dusty materials remaining after a stockpile is removed should be wetted with water and cleared from the surface of roads.\n- Any skip hoist for material transport should be totally enclosed by impervious sheeting.\n- The excavated materials produced during the construction would be transported by trucks and then unloaded to the barges. No stockpile area would be provided at the vertical seawall.\n- The haul roads connecting to the vertical seawall would be all paved. Vehicles should be washed to remove dusting materials from its wheels and bodies before leaving the construction site and entering the barging point. To alleviate the potential dust impacts, the dusty materials on the trucks would be well covered and flexible dust curtains would be provided at the loading points (from the berths of the vertical seawall to the barges).\n\n### Mitigation Measures for Disposal of Marine Sediments\n\nThe works shall follow the requirements and conditions from the DASO dumping permit.\n\n- All dumping vessels have to be approved in a marine dumping permit issued under the DASO.\n- Fit all hopper barges with tight-fitting seals to their bottom openings to prevent leakage of material.\n- Dumping should be carried out only at the specified site as shown in the permit.\n- Size all vessels such that adequate clearance is maintained between the seabed and vessels at all states of the tide, to ensure that undue turbidity is not generated by turbulence from vessel movement or propeller wash.\n- Release the sediments rapidly and close the hoppers immediately; any materials adhering to the sides of the hopper shall not be washed out of the hopper and the hopper shall remain closed until the barge returns to the disposal site.\n\n## 10. **Quality Control**\n\nRefer to Appendix B for Inspection and Test Plan. Construction works shall be fully complied with the Quality Plan. For work activity which is classified as “Quality Hold Point,” no subsequent work can be started unless the former work activity was inspected and accepted by MTR’s inspectorate.\n\n## 11. **Appendices (Identify and include additional information in the submission package)**\n\n- A.

New access gates will be provided to access the works area (Gate TT06, Gate TT07, and Gate TT0A) from the existing depot south road. At each access gate, a temporary diversion of the existing watermain and installation of the level crossings across the Test Track are required to access the construction area. Figures 1.1 and 1.2 show the existing condition of the work areas. In order to supply water, power, and concrete to discharge wastewater back to the south road, temporary cross-road ducts will be installed within the top ballast of the test track at each access gate.\n\nThe construction area between the Test Track and the Mainline is very narrow (8.5m to 12m wide), therefore once piling work commences, internal access through the works area will be constrained requiring the use of the level crossings together with a well-planned sequence of piling works to be adopted.\n\nThe works area will initially be fenced off with water-filled barriers followed by a temporary railway protection fence. Controlled ingress & egress at each access gate is required to prevent unauthorized entrance onto the Test Track and Main Line area. The method statement for the installation of the water-filled barrier/railway protection fence will be submitted separately.\n\nIn order to protect the existing railway infrastructure of the Test Track, such as the track and OHL mast/wire, a temporary 3.8m height gauge will be installed at each site entrance together with the level crossings.\n\nFigure 1.3 shows the arrangement for the temporary height gauge, access gate, and level crossing at each site entrance. Figure 1.4 shows the location of Gates TT06, TT07, and TT0A; the access gates are located at least 200m East of Signal SHD57 and at least 200m West of signal SHD009, the level crossings will not affect the existing trackside equipment.\n\n## 2. **Reference Documents**\n\n- (Library) Working Paper No.6 – Railway Protection\n- Approved EDOC (pending) for level crossing, height gauge installation\n- Approved BUGN (pending) for height gauge installation, if required\n- The supplier for level crossing is innoSTRAIL, please refer to ACC no. 1701-W-000-CSC-770-000079 for the material submission for the level crossing.\n\n## 3. **Details of Sub-Contractor/Specialist Sub-Contractor**\n\nThe works will be carried out by our subcontractor (pending award) and supervised by our front-line staff such as foreman and engineer.

Divert the existing watermain below the site entrance to provide access from the South Road to the work area.\n3. Installation of height gauge at the south road side.\n4. Remove the existing fence locally to form the site entrance.\n5. Construct the level crossing across the test track.\n6. Install the 2m height roller gauge and connect it to the height gauge.\n7. Construct the cross-track duct below the Test Track.\n8. Installation of height gauge at the test track side.\n9. Remove the temporary chain link fence.\n\nThe detailed construction method and sequence are shown as follows.\n\n### 8.2.1 Erect the 2.3m Temporary Chain Link Fence with Access Gate at South Road\n\nThe location of the proposed access gates TT06, TT07, and TT0A will be set out clearly on-site. A temporary chain link fence will be installed to fence off the work area. The chain link fence will be mounted on the South Road and secured with precast concrete blocks lifted into position with a crane lorry. This will then provide the 15m long and 3m wide work area needed for the watermain diversion, the setup as shown in Figure 8.2.1-1.\n\nThe sequence for erecting the temporary chain link fence and access is as follows:\n\n1. Set out the locations of proposed Gates TT06, TT07, and TTOA.\n2. Lift 5 nos. of 1m x 1m x 1m concrete blocks onto the south road which requires the south road to be fenced off during the lifting operation. Approval will be obtained from the Depot area, as shown in Figure 8.2.1-2. If necessary, the lifting works can be suspended and the road returned to MTR/other parties within 5 minutes if needed.\n\n### 8.2.2 Temp. diversion of the existing watermain to the underground area to provide access from South Road to work area\n\nThe existing watermain is located along the existing fence adjacent to the South Road as shown in Figure 8.2.2-1.\n\nThis watermain is planned to be diverted to AB23 by Contractor 1732 by April 2024, however, CSHK intends to maintain this route for our temporary water supply. The water main will be diverted below ground locally at each site entrance by removal of the existing concrete road surface and reinstatement after completion of the diversion works.\n\nThe sequence for the watermain diversion is as follows:\n- Before carrying out excavation works, UU detection (under separate submission) is to be carried out by a CP, and a permit to dig issued.\n- A pre-job briefing is required to be given prior to the commencement of works between the CP(T), WPIC, workers, and Site Engineer for the excavation work.\n- Saw cut the road surface to be removed using a road saw or sthil saw.\n- Remove the concrete road surface using a backhoe with breaker and excavate a 200mm wide, 500mm deep, and 8m long trench. 20mm Plywood protection board will be installed on the existing RP fence.\n- Compact the ground by vibration plate and install the watermain in the trench.\n- Inform MTR/Depot, Temporary shutdown the existing watermain.\n- Cut the existing watermain and connect the existing and new watermain.\n- Backfill and compact sand on top of the diverted watermain and place a 150mm wide, 6mm thick steel protection plate on top of the sand.\n- Backfill and compact with 100mm thick granular subbase.\n- Place steel mesh and concrete the reinstatement of the pavement. The concrete grade is 40/20D, thickness is 250mm, and shall be placed manually.\n\n### 8.2.3 Erect the height gauge\n\n## 9. **Safety**\n\n## 10. **Environmental**\n\n## 11. **Quality Control**\n\n## 12. **Appendices**\n\nThis document is controlled in soft copy.

We will use the traffic cone for temporary lane enclosure for loading and unloading. Deliver the water filled barrier by manual handing of workers. If it is delivery by lorry, at least two workers will move one barrier by manual handling. - Water filled barrier deliver by lorry at W7 and W3A, move the barrier from lorry to ground by manual handling. - Manual handling the water filled barrier to W3B and W3C. - For W3B, it will across the existing road, the CP(T) will supervise the works. |\n| 3    | Check the quality of water filled barrier, screw up the cover to prevent the water leakage. |\n| 4    | The barriers shall be placed in alternate red and white colours and connect together such that they stand out the construction site behind them and are visible by day and night. |\n| 5    | Fill in the water to the maximum water level of every water filled barrier according to the operating instructions of the manufacturer. - Due to the application for water supply needs to go through some process and takes time, in order not to affect the propose commencement date on 25 Jan 2024, we expected to use water tank to fill in the water into the wfb temporarily, and not use depot water, not borrow water from depot. Temporary water connection from existing water main at South Road will be discussed with depot separately, and it will cover by separate method statement. - The water tank would be filled outside the depot and use for filing the barrier. |\n| 6    | Check whether the water level is between the lowest water level and the highest water level daily. If there is no water after a day, it means that the cover is loose or the barrier is broken, so we should tighten the cover or replace it with a new water-filled barrier. |\n| 7    | Install the top plastic panel on the water filled barrier. - The plastic panels should have 1-2 transparent, and we will install the panels 1 in 5 to be transparent.

Construction Methods / Construction Sequence Drawings\n### 7.1 Introduction\nTwo types of CCTV will be adopted for 1701: The mobile solar power CCTV camera and fix mount solar power CCTV camera. All the CCTV camera could be access through the C-SMART platform except for the re-provision CCTV to deport. The Overall CCTV layout plan is attached in Appendix B.\n\n### 7.2 CCTV Installation Method\n#### 7.2.1 Installation of Mobile Solar Power CCTV Camera\nStand Trolley for Mobile Solar Powered CCTV, Size (H)93cm x (W)70cm x (D)40cm. The mobile solar power CCTV camera will be assembled and installed out of site which include:\n- Single Color Logo (Blue Color)\n- Hydraulic Pole from 1.5 meter to 3.5 meter x 2 nos\n- Solar Plate x 2 nos\n- Inverter x 1 nos\n- DC12V 200A Lithium Battery x 1 nos\n\nThe maximum height of mobile solar power CCTV camera is 3.5m.\n\n#### 7.2.2 Installation of Fix Mounted Solar Power CCTV camera\n**Step 1: Install the SIM Card**  \n(Required when using a CCTV with a SIM card.) Loosen the 2 screws at the bottom of the CCTV, open the card cover, and gently insert the SIM card according to the direction indicated by the notch. After that, re-tighten the 2 screws at the bottom of the camera to complete the installation.\n\n**Step 2: Choose the right mounting point**  \nThe first step is to survey the site and find a suitable point for CCTV installation. Selection of points generally have the following principles:\n- Installation angle as far as possible so that the area to be monitored falls within the scope of the camera focus clear;\n- Installation height will exceed the height of the human body, to avoid too low to be man-made damage, too high to be bad maintenance;\n\n**Step 3: Install the camera and solar panel**  \nThe CCTV is mounted directly on the lamp pole or concrete blocks with pole. Generally, the height of CCTV mounted on the lamp pole will be 6m and to be installed by aid of cherry picker. The height of CCTV mounted on a concrete block with pole would be 3m to be installed by aid of platform ladder.\n\nInstall solar panel by using the hexagonal wrench to fix the solar panel on the support arm. Mount camera by using two screws to fix the camera to the bracket first. Then pass the hoop through the pole and tighten the hoop screws to secure the bracket to the pole. Loosen vertical and horizontal adjustment screws, adjust the camera to desired scene to be monitored, tighten the adjustment screws, and complete the installation.\n\n### 7.2.3 Network connection of solar panel CCTV camera\n**(1) General Network Connection System**  \nAccording to the existing CCTV layout plan, the wireless network linking could be achieved by using Leap X, Network Receiver and Wireless Bridge. The fundamental topology theory of the network is similar as tree diagram:\n1. The network of the whole system is received by Network Receiver then transit to relatively nearer wireless bridge and CCTV camera via cable/fiber.\n2. The network of further Leap X and CCTV/C-Smart camera will be linked by the signal of wireless bridge via cable/fiber.\n3. The rest of CCTV/C-Smart cameras are going to link to network by 5.8G Leap X network. The following is the draft network connection system for 1701.\n\n**Alternative Network Connection**  \nFor those area couldn’t connect to the network system, SIM card(s) will be adopted with the following specification or similar to the CCTV camera(s).\n\n- 250GB 5G (FUP CDP) + [bundle] Peplink BR1 + Fixed IP\n\n## 8. Safety (Risk Assessments)\nRisk Assessment attached in Appendix A has been prepared for all general activities. Specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow. The Construction Team Leader together with the RSO, will supervise the implementation and make adjustment according to the actual site operations, in order to maintain a safe and amicable working environment.\n\n## 9. Environmental (Environmental aspect & impact identification as well as mitigation measures)\nThe following mitigation measures will be followed:\n- General works shall be carried out during normal hours from 08:00 am to 07:00 pm. No works will be carried out after 07:00 pm on Sunday or public holiday without approval construction noise permit.\n- Plant with QPME label will be employed, if available.\n- NRMM Label will be affixed to PME as required.\n\n## 10.

The major plant and equipment that will be deployed to carry out the works are as follows:\n\n### Plant / Equipment used for Precast Beam/Slab Delivery Operation\n\n| Vessel Type         | Tentative Size (Overall Length x Breadth x Draft) |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Delivery Barge      | 49m x 15m x 3.5m                                 |\n| Crane Barge         | S.W.L.: 200 tons. 50m x 25m x 1.5m               |\n| Heavy Lifting Barge | 61.2m x 21.3m x 2.8m                             |\n| Supporting Vessel: Tugboat | 21.3m x 6.6m x 1.8m                       |\n| Guard Boat / Rescue Boat | 61.2m x 21.3m x 2.8m                        |\n\n### Plant / Equipment used for Disposal of C&D materials\n\n| Vessel Type         | Typical Size (Overall Length x Breadth x Draft)  |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| RoRo Barge with Tipping Hall | 41.9m x 18.3m x 1.2m                    |\n| Hopper Barge       | 55.5m x 21.7m x 3m                                |\n\n## 7. **Construction Methods / Construction Sequence**\n\n### 7.0 Existing Vertical Seawall\n\nThe seawall is located at the north side of Siu Ho Wan depot.\n\n- The overall length of this vertical seawall: ~ 140 m\n- Constructed with precast concrete blocks\n  - Toe level is -5.5 mPD\n\n### 7.1 Use of Seawall\n\nThe seawall will be used for material delivery to site, such as precast materials and DfMA modules, and material disposal offsite, such as C&D materials. The precast materials will mainly be delivered to W11. Also, the C&D materials will mainly be excavated from W11.\n\n### 7.2 Traffic Arrangements from W11 to Seawall through VAB\n\nTo facilitate the traffic arrangement between W11 and the vertical seawall, the traffic routing from W11 to the seawall is shown in the following figures. There are 2 routings which are for shorter vehicles (below 12m) and longer vehicles (12m to 18m) respectively. The tentative dump truck traffic volume at the barging point will be 12 dump trucks per hour.\n\nThe traffic routing from W11 to the seawall for longer vehicles (12m to 18m) is proposed in order to avoid using the existing depot road to the West of AB1 and to minimize the use of the main depot road, such that we do not affect the MTR depot daily operation and the operation of the MTR shuttle bus stop. The use of the existing west level crossing or level crossings at the east side of the main building is required to allow the long vehicles to deliver to Works Area W11 as they are unable to turn around to access the Works Area via the temporary vehicular bridge when leaving the seawall.\n\nThe traffic routing utilizes the water-filled barriers to reduce the traffic arms. The level crossing located east of the main building can be used occasionally for special cases. However, MTR does not recommend CSHK to use it frequently. Therefore, MTR advised CSHK to adopt the routing passing through the west level crossing. A CP(T) escort shall be provided and CSHK shall maintain the 4m permissible height rule when using the level crossings.\n\nThe swept path analysis for this routing is included in the Traffic Management Plan (Main Stage) under separate submission.\n\n### 7.3 Seawall Gate Arrangement\n\nFor the seawall gate arrangements, please refer to the Traffic Management Plan (Main Stage) under separate submission.\n\nCSHK will provide CCTV at the seawall access gates to allow depot staff to monitor the seawall site condition.\n\n### 7.4 Joint Use of Seawall with CEDD Contract C7\n\nContract C7 is currently utilizing the seawall for their construction works. CSHK is required to liaise with CEDD to arrange joint use of the seawall. According to Contract C7, they will utilise the seawall until the end of 2024. For the booking arrangements of the seawall with the depot and Contract C7, please refer to the separate submission ‘Method Statement of Disposal of C&D materials’.\n\n### 7.7 Material Delivery\n\n#### 7.7.1 Estimation of Material Required for Delivery\n\nThe following is the estimation of materials to be delivered via marine transportation:\n1. Steel trusses for the construction of the OYB Link Bridges.\n2. Precast I-beams for L-Shape Link Bridge construction and precast RC units for Phase 3D Sewerage Deck construction\n   - Total 8 nos. of Precast I-Beams\n3. Precast RC beams and slabs for OYB construction\n   - Over 370 nos. of pre-cast U-shaped beam shells\n   - Over 1000 nos. of pre-cast slabs\n4. Phase 3D Sewerage Deck construction\n   - 101 nos. of precast RC units\n\n#### 7.7.2 Delivery Schedule\n\nThe precast components will be delivered to site for assembly, including beams and slabs, starting from Feb 2025 to 2027 tentatively. The estimated delivery schedule of the precast components is shown in the figure below:\n\nThere are two main components of precast:\n\n| Component | Period for Delivery | Max Dimension for Planning Purpose | Total |\n|-----------|---------------------|------------------------------------|-------|\n| Beam      | February 2025 - April 2027 | 3.2m wide * 4.25m deep * 26.3m long | 185   |\n| Slab      | February 2025 - April 2027 | 1.2m wide * 0.5m (deep T) * 10m long | 3200  |\n\n#### 7.7.3 Unloading of material from barge\n\n- The process of unloading materials from a barge involves transferring goods or supplies from the barge to a designated location on land. This can be accomplished using various methods and equipment, depending on the type of cargo and the available infrastructure.\n- A crane is positioned on the dock or shoreline, and it utilizes a lifting mechanism and cables to hoist the cargo from the barge and place it onto the designated area. The crane operator carefully maneuvers the cargo, following specific instructions and safety protocols.\n- Where large quantities of construction materials, such as steel beams or concrete blocks, need to be unloaded from a barge. A crane with a suitable lifting capacity is positioned on the dock adjacent to the barge. The crane operator communicates with the crew on the barge, who attach the cargo to be unloaded to the crane's lifting hook. The crane operator then operates the crane, lifting the materials from the barge and placing them onto the long vehicle.\n\n#### 7.7.4 Berthing Arrangement for Material Delivery on-site\n\nFor transporting of precast materials, a Derrick Lighter will transport the construction materials to the Site via marine access. The proposed berthing arrangement is as shown in the Figure below:\n\n- 2 vessels can be accommodated at the barging facility concurrently. One can berth at the seawall for loading/unloading operations whilst the 2nd vessel will be berthed at the Spoil removal barge for disposal of excavated materials.\n\n## 8. **Safety**\n\n### 8.1 General Safety\n\n- All workers shall attend a site-specific induction course conducted by CSHK Safety Team.
