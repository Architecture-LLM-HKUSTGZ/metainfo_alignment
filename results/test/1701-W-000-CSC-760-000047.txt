7.1 – Cable Routing

In terms of power supply to the kitchen, 2 nos. of 300mm2 XLPE/SWA/LSHF cable will be provided for the power distribution from new fuse switch panel to be fed from MSB-2.2 at LV Switch Room to MCCB board located at Dry Store. The cables will be terminated at newly installed fuse switch panel respectively for power supply fed from MSB-2.2 in G/F Room 8.27 LV Switch Room and started running at existing cable riser up to upper ground floor (UG/F) and turn to Canteen Dining Area high level towards steel deck of kitchen at UG/F. The cable containment will be mounted on existing structural steel frame. The following sketches and photos indicated the proposed cable routing in RED. Drawings of cable routing refer to the Appendix A. 

The 300mm2 XLPE/SWA/LSHF cables will be terminated to the new fuse switch panel before power energisation, and no power isolation is required. Therefore, the cable termination work would not affect the general operation of Depot.

<!-- Cable at H/L & T/A Layout of LV Switch Room (Room No. 8.27) at Ground Floor  -->

Since the working at height would be taken place in the LV Switch Room, the ceiling permit system should be implemented. The sample of ceiling permit refers to the Appendix E.
