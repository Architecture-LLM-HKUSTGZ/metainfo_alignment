7. Construction Methods/Construction Sequence Drawings
7.0- Precautions before Work
Before any drilling works, cover meter or wall scanner will be used to confirm the absence of concealed or cast-in conduits or items inside a slab or wall before drilling. Guideline/ general procedure on how to use a cover meter / wall scanner will be given and briefing will be provided to workers who use the equipment before they operate. For any drilling or coring works on wall or slab, detection and scanning shall be carried out in order to recognize the concealed services inside existing partitions, a Permit-to-drill/core shall be signed and issued before carrying out the corresponding works as well. Also, pre-work briefing is a must before carrying out works on site to make sure all parties identify the forthcoming tasks, natures, potential hazards and risks, as well as the contingency and emergency plans during works.

7.1 – Cable Routing
In terms of power supply to the kitchen, 2 nos. of 300mm2 XLPE/SWA/LSHF cable will be provided for the power distribution from new fuse switch panel to be fed from MSB-2.2 at LV Switch Room to MCCB board located at Dry Store. The cables will be terminated at newly installed fuse switch panel respectively for power supply fed from MSB-2.2 in G/F Room 8.27 LV Switch Room and started running at existing cable riser up to upper ground floor (UG/F) and turn to Canteen Dining Area high level towards steel deck of kitchen at UG/F. The cable containment will be mounted on existing structural steel frame. The following sketches and photos indicated the proposed cable routing in RED. Drawings of cable routing refer to the Appendix A.

The 300mm2 XLPE/SWA/LSHF cables will be terminated to the new fuse switch panel before power energisation, and no power isolation is required. Therefore, the cable termination work would not affect the general operation of Depot.

Since the working at height would be taken place in the LV Switch Room, the ceiling permit system should be implemented. The sample of ceiling permit refers to the Appendix E.

Cable Riser at UG/F

After cable containment completed, the cable laying works will start subsequently. There will be 2 nos. 300mm2 XLPE/ SWA/LSHF cable laying from LV switch room 8.27 to kitchen. The location of cable drum was proposed at outside the LV switchboard as shown as part plan and photo.

The electric chain blocks for cable laying will be powered by temporary portable generator and it will be located outside SHD, which is adjacent to Room 8.25 – Pre-action Sprinkler Control Valve Room at G/F. Temporary fencing work will be provided in order not to obstruct the passage and provide protection as shown in below figure.

Proposed Location of Portable Generator and Protection Work

7.3 – Installation Location of Power Supply Equipment
The following listed summary of the equipment and location. The details refer to below tables and photos.

Location: Dry Store
Equipment: - 400A 10 Way TPN MCCB Board
           - 400A 12 Way TPN MCCB Board

Location: Kitchen Area
Equipment: - 63A TPN Isolating Switch
           - 32A TPN Isolating Switch

7.4 – Cable Termination on Fuse Switch Panel
Two nos. 300mm2 XLPE/ SWA/LSHF which will be terminated to the new fuse switch panel adjacent to Panel 12 of LV switchboard MSB-2.2 for power supply to kitchen as below diagram. Power isolation may be required during the cable termination on fuse switch panel next to MSB-2.2 if the fuse switch panel is energised in advance. The detail schedule of work activities refers to Appendix B.

7.4.1 – Procedure of Cable Termination
I. The cables prior to being cut, appropriate tail length of cables shall be remained for terminated at the LV switchboard.
II. The cables will be top entry of LVSB’s rear compartment and properly gland on top of LVSB.
III. The cables sheath shall be clasped by a gland with a compression washer which will hold the cable sheath securely.
IV. The termination of the cable conductors shall be crimpled by cable lug with a hydraulic crimping tool.
V. The cables connected to the designated busbar by bolts & nuts.

7.5 – Temporary Material Storage and Delivery Route
Two locations are proposed as the temporary storage area for the installation materials, the first location is the area outside Room 8.27 LV Switch Room at G/F MDB. Corresponding location is shown in the following sketch and bracketed in RED.

The general delivery route of those installation materials should be delivered by Truck, starting from the West Entry Gate of SHD. After obtaining entry by Security Staffs at Gate, the truck will go along the depot access road until MDB Entrance, and the materials will be unloaded at the Carpark nearby and deliver to the designated temporary storage area at G/F and 1/F respectively. The respective delivery routes in MDB are shown in above sketches in BLUE.

8. Safety (Risk Assessments)
Risk Assessment attached in Appendix H has been prepared for all general activities. Specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow. The Construction Team Leader together with the RSO, will supervise the implementation and make adjustments according to the actual site operations, in order to maintain a safe and amicable working environment.

General Site Safety
With reference to the Project Safety Plan, the following items need to be instituted through the course of the works described within this method statement.

Prevention of Fire
- Do not smoke or light fires near flammable equipment and fire exits.
- Familiarise yourself where to find firefighting equipment and fire exits.
- Recognise how to use the firefighting equipment.
- Keep means of escape clear and unobstructed.
- Do not obstruct access to fire extinguishers.
- Learn the operation and limitations of the fire extinguishers in your area.
- Do not hang clothing over or near heating equipment and no debris is allowed.
- Report smoke or fire to your supervisor immediately.

PPE
- All workers and site personnel shall wear safety helmet, reflective jacket and safety boots on site.
- Depending on work nature, different PPE will be required.
- CP(NT) or WPIC will ensure the workers are wearing suitable PPE while working in Depot Area.

Warning Signs
- Warning labels with emergency contact list will be provided during works.
- Temporary fence-off for working area should be provided if necessary.

Risk Assessment
All the potential hazards, consequences and mitigations will be analysed in the risk assessment attached in the Appendix H.

Plant & Equipment
1 Hand Tools

9. Environmental (Environmental aspect & impact identification as well as mitigation measures)
The following mitigation measures will be followed:
- General works shall be carried out during normal working hours (08:00 to 18:00). No works using PME will be carried out after 07:00pm on Sunday and public holiday without a valid construction noise permit.
- Dust control shall be strictly followed during works in Depot Area, appropriate protection and isolation work shall be provided prior to carrying out works.
- The works shall follow relevant mitigation measures as required under the Environmental Permit (EP) / EP submission and Contractor’s Environmental Management Plan (EMP).

10. Quality Control (Inspection and Test Plan including hold points)
To ensure the attainment of the required standard of works, the methods of working and the required works standards / acceptance criteria are defined in the method statement, inspection & test plans, and are communicated to relevant staff and workers carrying out the works. Day to day routine inspections of the works will be carried out by the Construction Team Leader, Site Engineers and Foreman as appropriate, to ensure that all works are performed following the requirements of these documents. Specific quality checks shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Inspection & Test Plan with “Hold Points” at critical elements for confirmation of compliance before proceeding further. Request for Inspection and Testing (RIT) for BS installations, inspections and T&Cs shall be issued to the MTR by the CSHK’s project team. The Inspection & Test Plan for the works attached as Appendix I will identify all Hold Points and Witness Points. Following the Inspection & Test carried out, inspection and / or test records are to be prepared to indicate whether the specified requirements have been met. Records of Inspection and testing will be maintained and kept available for inspection and final handover as appropriate.
