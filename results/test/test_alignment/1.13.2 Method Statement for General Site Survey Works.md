Based on the site reconnaissance information, pre-analysis will be prepared by using of the survey software to estimate the error propagation of the control network survey or traverse survey designed. • Precise Total-station TS16A or equivalent/ higher standard instrument accepted by MTR will be employed. Instrument specification is 1 second in direction an 1m m+1.5ppm in distance measurement. • An observation diagram and schedule are prepared to list out all the targets to be observed from each specific stand survey control station. The idea of the schedule is to listed out as many targets as visibility permits so that all known survey control stations will be included from the observation. • Four arcs of reading on both face left and face right will be observed to all the targets as listed in observation schedule. All directions are to be read in whole circle bearing around the clock. Observation data is to be recorded into Total-station internal memory or removable memory. • Instrument height, target height and meteorological data shall be recorded. • Set Zero on ppm is to be applied on the instrument during observation. Temperature and Pressure measurements are to be recorded at both ends of the line during the distance measurement for atmospheric correction on the measured distance. • The position of the set-up station which is fixed survey control station shall be checked by observing angles and distances to at least two known stations with an included angle and at least one distance measurement. • Acceptable criteria in direction measurement, Standard Deviation of the Mean, o, of each reduced horizontal observed included angle shall not be greater than +/-3 second of arc. • Acceptable criteria in distance measurement, Standard deviation of the Mean, o, of each reduced observed distance shall not be greater than +/-2mm. The distance must be measured by an EDM or Total-Station. Each line is measured with at least one pointing with three measures. All necessary corrections shall be applied.|

|Col1|7.1.4 Requirements • In case the Master survey control stations are found to be damaged or in error, CSHK will inform to MTR. • Sufficient working space shall be made available around each station to enable the necessary instrument to be erected and operated. • CSHK shall supply a copy of the field notes in a neat and legible form showing all the point numbers, measurements, observations and sketches of the survey works to MTR for record. 7.1.5 Computation and Accuracy • All the survey data are logged into the Total-Station internal memory or removable memory card will be transferred to computer for processing in a raw data format. • The logged data will be re-arrayed and checked against with the field record. The organized electronic data will then be passed to an electronic spreadsheet for data reduction. The computation will be processed as a traverse or network adjustment with survey software such as "StarNet". The software employs least square method to provide best fit adjustment for all survey observation and evaluate the accuracy of control stations. • A survey report on the establishment of the survey control stations will be submitted to MTR for review and comment. The report comprises all the documents throughout the process of evaluating the co-ordinates of these survey control stations including a copy of field record, electronic observed data and survey software output report. 7.2 Vertical Control: CSHK shall base on those verified Master Benchmarks to establish a precise levelling survey control network. 7.2.1 Origin and Datum of Survey • The following survey benchmarks provided by MTR will be adopted as origin for vertical control: MOB501 to MOB510, 212019 and 212025. These master controls, the being base frame of the survey network, will be further broken into primary and secondary control for daily survey operation and all vertical levels of the works shall be referenced to and expresses in either: • Hong Kong Principal Datum (HKPD) which is the height datum generally used in Hong Kong and referred through the benchmarks of Lands Department; or • Chart Datum (CD) which is 0.15m below HKPD • All Precise levelling benchmarks shall be surveyed by a closed levelling network which shall be tied to a minimum of two verified Master Benchmarks.|
