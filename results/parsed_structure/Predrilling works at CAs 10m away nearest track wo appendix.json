        "8. **Safety**": "- Ensure all personnel are trained and aware of the safety procedures. - Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times. - Implement permit-to-work systems for excavation and lifting operations. - Conduct regular safety briefings and toolbox talks. - Monitor and enforce safety compliance on site.",
        "9. **Environmental**": "- Minimize noise and dust generation during drilling operations. - Properly manage and dispose of drilling waste and spoil. - Implement measures to prevent contamination of soil and water. - Monitor environmental parameters as required by the project’s environmental management plan.",
        "10. **Quality Control**": "- Ensure all drilling operations are carried out as per the approved method statement and drawings. - Perform regular inspections and tests to verify compliance with specifications. - Maintain accurate and detailed records of all drilling activities and test results. - Submit all required documentation and reports to the RSE/RGE’s site representative for review and approval.",
