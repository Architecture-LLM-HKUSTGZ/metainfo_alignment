The cable containment will be mounted on existing structural steel frame. ##### 3.2 Cable Termination on Modified LV switchboard Since there are two nos. 300mm² XLPE/SWA/LSHF which will be terminated to the Panel 12 of MSB2.2 of modified LV switchboard for power supply to kitchen as below diagram. The power suspension is required during the cable termination on MSB2.2 of modified LV switchboard. ##### 3.3 Procedure of Cable Termination 1. The cables prior to being cut, appropriate tail length of cables shall be remained for terminated at the fuse switch panel next to switchboard MSB-2.2. 2. The cables will be top entry of fuse switch panel’s rear compartment and properly gland on top of panel. 3. The cables sheath shall be clasped by a gland with a compression washer which will hold the cable sheath securely. 4. The termination of the cable conductors shall be crimpled by cable lug with a hydraulic crimping tool. 5. The cables connected to the designated busbar by bolts & nuts. #### D. Existing LV Switchboard Modification Works Involved: The existing LV switchboard was planned to modify part of riser busbar for the connection of new busbar containment on power supply to new fuse switch panel. The works are split into two parts – A. new fuse switch panel & busbar installation: and B. Existing LV switchboard of busbar modification and connection to busbar in Part A. ##### 1. Installation of New Fuse Switch Panel In order to sufficiently cater the power supply of new electric kitchen stoves and appliances, a new fuse switch panel will be installed and new fuse switches for aforesaid equipment in kitchen will be installed on that panel. The new fuse switch panel is pre-fabricated in factory, which can be easily installed in Room 8.27 – LV Switch Room with simple fixing works. The energisation of the new fuse switch panel will be carried out upon the installation and prompt testing of new busbar section connecting from existing Panel 12 of MSB-2.2 which to be indicated in specific part below. 2 nos. of 400A fuse switch will also be installed in this panel as the power points of new electric kitchen appliances. Since the installation work of new fuse switch panel does not require power interruption, the work, hence, could be carried out at the daytime. ##### 1.1 Procedure of New Fuse Switch Panel Installation a. Approval shall be obtained prior to work in SHD. b. Working area of the work will be fenced off to prevent unauthorised entry. c. Perform pre-work briefing to all related personnel for introduction of work to be carried out and safety issues in advance. d. Work commences. The fuse switch panel and new busbar section will be moved from temporary storage area into the designated location in LV Switch Room, then fix the panel for further busbar and cable termination. e. Install the new busbar section between MSB-2.2 and new fuse switch panel. The termination is to be carried out upon switchboard modification. f. Check and confirm that no foreign object is left inside the panel cubicle in advance after the installation work. g. Complete works and leave LV Switch Room. ##### 2. Modification and Extension of Busbar A new section of busbar will be extended to the new fuse switch panel from Panel 12 of existing LV switchboard MSB-2.2. A new spur will be modified from existing 2000A riser busbar inside Panel 12, the new busbar section connecting the new spur inside Panel 12 and fuse switch panel adjacent to Panel 12 will be installed afterwards. The new busbar section will be fully enclosed in the ceiling-mounted trunking, no live part to be exposed. ##### 2.1 Procedure of Busbar Modification a. Site work team arrive at SHD for preparation, all relevant permits should be granted and issued correspondingly prior to work commencement. b. Report duty to Yard Master regarding the works to obtain approval to work in Depot during Non-traffic Hour of the day (NTH). c. Perform pre-work briefing to all related personnel for introduction of work to be carried out and safety issues in advance. d. Ready for works in Room 8.27 LV Switch Room, working area in the room will be fenced off to prevent unauthorised entry. e. Work commences when NTH starts. Shut down the outgoing fuse switches on non-essential side one-by-one, then confirm with PSC to switch off the corresponding ACBs under remote control for power isolation. f. Open the rear cover of Panel 12 and carry out isolation test to make sure the power supply is completely isolated, then draw-out and padlock the switches to prevent re-energisation during works. g. Remove existing busbar and install new riser busbar inside Panel 12 of MSB-2.2 to cater the busbar extension. h. Connect and terminate the busbar between 2000A riser in Panel 12 and new fuse switch panel adjacent to Panel 12. i. Carry out function tests (e.g. megger test, Ductor Test, Torque Wrench Test, continuity test, insulation test, etc.) to ensure the correct termination of new busbar. j. Enclose all the busbar connection and termination points and reinstate the rear cover of Panel 12 of MSB-2.2, check and confirm that no foreign object is left inside the panel cubicle in advance after the installation work. k. Resume the power supply by confirming with PSC to switch on the incoming and section ACBs under remote control. Observation of power supply condition after power resumption shall be taken afterwards. l. Leave and lock the switch room after work and power supply resumption without leaving tools and equipment. Cancel the work permits and report to Yard Master regarding the work completion. After inspection and testing of new fuse switch panel and busbar section, energisation will be conducted and that the power cables connecting to electric appliances in SHD Kitchen will be terminated to the fuse switches once ready. After cable termination, testing will be carried out as well to ensure the normal power supply to the aforesaid equipment.",
        "5. **Testing for Work Completion**": "After the modification works are completed, T&C would be carried out to ensure the proper installation and termination of switchboard and fuse switch panel before official energization. Tests to be conducted for T&C refer to step i.) of Procedure of Busbar Modification. Once T&C result is accepted, WR1 certificate shall be issued by REW as the proof of works completion. The new fuse switches should thus be remained off and padlocked until the outgoing sub-circuit between fuse switch panel and MCCB boards installed in 1/F Kitchen Dry Store can be terminated and energized.",
