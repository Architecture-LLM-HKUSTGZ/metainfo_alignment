        "8. Construction Methods / Construction Sequence": "### Drawings Preparation - All works before commencement must contact depot YM to get approval first. - Identify the existing MTR facilities at or within construction site, such as manhole cover, OHL portal. Carry out the condition survey and photographic record to locate the UU before any excavation works. Permit to dig system will be implemented to ensure protection system to the existing UU before commencement of works. The method statement will be submitted separately. - If condition survey found MTR existing equipment/material, we will fence off the existing MTR stuff first and have protection. After condition survey, we will give the results to depot and liaise about the existing MTR stuff. - All workers should possess the qualification Railway Safety training (RSI), and can only smoke at the smoking area that demarcated by CSHK. ### For Crane Lorry and Lifting Gear - All plants and equipment will be inspected prior to the mobilization on site to ensure that they are in good working condition and comply with the current regulations., all statutory forms/certificates of Lifting Appliances (LA) and Lifting Gear (LG) must be valid. - If they are in good working condition, CSHK will arrange the plants mobilization to site. - Before operation of the plant, CSHK will arrange a plant inspection with MTR CWBU inspector. - If they are in good working condition, CSHK will submit the permit to lift (for crane lorry, grab lorry lifting gear) and plant permit (for backhoe). - The Safe Working Load (SWL) is required to be shown on lifting appliance or to lifting gear. - All lifting work is to be in accordance with the F&IU (lifting appliance and lifting gear regulations). ### Lunch Arrangement for CSHK workers If number of workers less than 10 people, worker can have their lunch at depot canteen after 12:30pm, if number of workers more than 10 people, worker will go out the site for lunch or arrange meal box to them. ### The sequence for site clearance at W11 is shown in the following table | Step | Activity | Picture | |------|----------|---------| | 1 | Fence off the site clearance area / crane operation area by plastic barrier. Deploy grab lorry or 13ton/20ton backhoe(s) to remove weeds and garbage. The backhoe will be transport on site by trailer. Weeds shall be removed away from Depot asap as it will catch fire easily. Fire fighting equipment must be provided. | - | | 2 | To remove the garbage, CSHK will provide the information for MTR CWBU inspector to fill in the material transfer record sheet to the SOC. CSHK will arrange the grab lorry to transport the garbage to the waste disposal. | - | | 3 | The existing UU within the proposed working area will be detected and recorded in layout plan prior to works commencement. Existing drainage manhole cover will also be opened to inspect the condition. Please refer to the method statement of General Underground Utility Survey for Construction Area (CA) for details. | - | | 4 | Submit the UU detection report and railway facility & manhole drainage report to MTR. The limitation will be clearly stated in the UU detection report, e.g. survey unreliable or survey not successful with appropriate safety protective measures. Ground Penetration Radar shall be considered in high risk area advised by CP. | - | | 5 | Utilizing plastic barriers will be provided to protect existing UU covers and enhance protection. | - | | 6 | Site inspection will MTR / HKTS representative will be carried out to identify whether if these covers and other existing facilities, e.g. existing pole, to be retained or not.

Safety briefing will be conducted by CP before the existing the hard paving / abandon covers and facilities removal works. The excavation / hard pave removal works will be limited to 300mm depth from ground. Excavators will be deployed to remove the hard paving and abandon facilities. | - |",
        "9. Safety": "Lifting zone must be fenced off by fencing before lifting. All personnel cannot stay in the lifting zone until the lifting item placed on the ground. Outrigger of the crane lorry must be fully extended. Appropriate dimension of parts must be used. The ground stability must be checked before lifting. Risk Assessment attached in Appendix A has been prepared for all general activities. Specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow. The Construction Team Leader together with the RSO, will supervise the implementation and make adjustment according to the actual site operations, in order to maintain a safe and amicable working environment.",
