    "1.13.78 (CS) Site Clearance and Fencing Installation at WDET Area (including Works Areas W12, W11G, W11D)": {
        "1. Introduction": "Prior to the commencement of piling works for the depot structures, a 7m high Railway Protection (RP) fence will be installed to protect the existing railway infrastructure from the adjacent construction works. This method statement describes the general method and sequence of site clearance and RP fence installation at the West Depot Entry Track (WDET) including Works Areas W12, W11G, and W11D within the depot area, from GLA1 to GL17 as shown in Figure 1.1. It includes the dismantling of the existing chain link fence and the installation of new fence in Area W12, however, this does not affect the WDET. Supplementary method statements shall be submitted separately to tackle any condition encountered on site that requires a specific RP fence detail to be developed. The detailed protection fence setting out plan or installation details will be provided under separate submission. As some works will be carried out in Operation Areas, EDOCs are required to be submitted. The lifting plan and protection measures to the existing OA equipment/utilities shall be submitted separately after detailed site inspections and surveys have been completed. All necessary UU diversions along the WDET as per Figures 1.2 and 1.3 below (such as signaling equipment, cables in troughs, cable draw pits, etc.) will be completed by the designated contractors before commencement of the site clearance and RP fence installation. This method statement assumes that the cable troughs to either side of the WDET are not diverted, however, and the positioning of the fence support blocks will reflect this. UU detection will be conducted after site clearance to verify any uncharted UUs found. The method statement for UU detection is under separate submission.",

Subject to site condition and agreement with depot/RP/HKTS, the works will be carried out during NPH, subject to the PA works approval. As the fence is being erected close to the existing OHL infrastructure, the OHL must be de-energised, earthed, and isolated to allow lifting close to the OHL. An AP(E) and PTW(E) are required to supervise the OHL isolation works.",
        "6. Plant, Equipment & Material": "All plant and equipment will be inspected prior to mobilisation on site to ensure that they are in good working condition and comply with all current regulations. A plant permit system and permit to lift will be adopted to ensure the condition of the lifting crane and lifting equipment are checked before use. To meet the programme requirement, 3 work fronts will be mobilised for the WDET. The major plant and equipment that will be deployed to carry out the works are as follows: ### Work Area at WDET: 3 no. Workfronts: | Plant/Equipment | Quantity | |-----------------|----------| | Mobile Crane    | 3        | | Cherry Picker   | 3        | | Compactor       | 3        | | Ladder Platform | 3        | ### Manpower: | Manpower       | Quantity | |----------------|----------| | General Labour | 9        | | Driver         | 3        | | Rigger         | 6        | | Operator       | 3        |",

        "8. Construction Methods / Construction Sequence": "### 8.1 Site Clearance, Ground Levelling and Temporary Platform for WDET Fence Installation Prior to the RP fencing installation, site clearance and ground levelling will be carried out to remove vegetation, abandoned cable troughs by manual handling, remove cable manholes, track signage, and to level up the ground condition to create a level stable platform for RP fence installation. To meet the programme requirements, it is planned to have 3 work fronts at peak as shown in Figure 8.1-1 below. The existing ground level varies slightly but in general lies between approx. 5.5m and 6.5mPD. This will be readily flattened by levelling; no high rockhead is known to be present in this area. Following levelling of the existing ground, a temporary working platform will be formed for subsequent works; granular sub-base will be used to fill and level up the existing ground condition and will be well compacted by vibratory rollers with repeated passes, with the actual number of passes to achieve the specified level of compaction subject to the weight of the roller. #### Steps: 1. **Install Barrier (NPH)**: Water-filled barriers will be installed along both sides of the WDET (2.8m distance from the centre of the nearest track) to delineate a working area which can then be defined as a CA (Construction Area). All subsequent works, except for RP fence platform preparation and fence installation directly adjacent to the OHL infrastructure, can then be carried out during traffic hours (TH). 2. **Remove Vegetation, Level and Compact Ground behind Water Barriers (TH)**: A 3 or 5-ton excavator, to suit availability, will be delivered to the works areas via the access roads. Site clearance and ground levelling will be carried out with the assistance of the excavator. In general, granular sub-base will be used for ground levelling. The sub-base, if required, will be delivered to the works area by 5.5-ton dump trucks. Rubbish removal and material delivery will be by manual delivery. For manual removal and delivery, access to the works areas will be via the existing west wheel wash road and south depot road. 3. **Form the Working Platform for the RP Fence (NPH)**: This work will be carried out over the water-filled barriers and hence requires NPH. It is essentially the same as Step 2 but with the added railway precautions enabled by NPH working. Currently, it is not anticipated to remove the existing cable troughs, but rather to work around them. ### 8.2 Install the Earthing System at Ground Level During TH After forming the temporary platform and compacting the sub-base, the electrode rod and earthing pit will be installed below the ground level at a maximum spacing of 20m along the proposed RP Fence, as shown in Figure 8.2-1. ### 8.3 RP Fence Installation Upon completion of the site clearance and working platform, the RP fence installation will commence. The details of the RP fence setting out are shown in Appendix C. The sequence of work is as follows: Construction works will be carried out in close proximity to the existing test track and WDET which require robust railway protection measures to be in place before commencement of any physical site works. Referring to (Library) Working Paper No.6 & the approved BUGN-Railway Protection (pending), a minimum 7 m high fence is proposed for activities which require the use of plant/machinery with high booms adjacent to the fence, or where the OHL masts are located on that side of the track. The minimum clearance between fence mesh and the OHL fault return wire is required to be at least 850 mm, but may be reduced with electrical isolation introduced, and with the agreement of MTRC. The closest part of the fence structure is required to have a minimum of 2615 mm clearance to the track centre for tracks inside the depot (Scope Cl. S205.6.11(i)). As the installation of the RP fence will be undertaken in close proximity to the OHL line (within 2m radius), an AP(E) and PTW(E) are also required to be provided. The RP Fence installation works will be undertaken during NPH after the OHL has been de-energised. The footing and RP fence frame will be prefabricated off-site using a standard size to allow installation of the footing and fence frame directly on site. As the final distance between the OHL & RP fence will be only 150mm, an insulation coating is provided and installed on the RP fence at OHL level. The details of the 7m fence are shown in Figure 8.3-1. The tentative dimensions of the insulation coating can be referred to Figure 1.6. The concrete footings will be interlocked by PFC steel ties as shown in Figure 8.3-2. For the layout plan of the RP Fence please refer to Appendix C.",
        "9. Safety": "Safety is paramount in all construction activities, especially when working in close proximity to operational railway lines. The following safety measures will be implemented: - **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** All workers will wear appropriate PPE including helmets, high-visibility vests, gloves, and safety boots. - **Railway Safety Training (RSI):** All workers will have completed RSI training and will be familiar with the specific risks associated with railway environments. - **Site Induction:** All personnel will undergo a site-specific induction covering the scope of works, safety procedures, emergency protocols, and specific risks. - **Toolbox Talks:** Regular toolbox talks will be conducted to address specific tasks, potential hazards, and safety measures. - **Safety Inspections:** Daily safety inspections will be carried out by the Safety Officer to ensure compliance with safety protocols. - **Emergency Procedures:** Emergency procedures will be established and communicated to all workers. Emergency contact numbers will be displayed prominently on site. - **First Aid:** First aid facilities and trained first aid personnel will be available on site at all times. - **Isolation of OHL:** The OHL will be de-energized, earthed, and isolated before any work commences near the OHL infrastructure.",
        "10. Environmental": "Environmental considerations are integral to the project. The following measures will be implemented to minimize environmental impact: - **Noise Control:** Works will be carried out during normal hours from 08:00 am to 07:00 pm and outside of normal hours after 07:00 pm on Monday to Sunday with an approved construction noise permit. - **Use of ULSD Diesel:** Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) will be used in all Plant and Machinery Equipment (PME). - **QPME Label:** Plant with Quality Powered Mechanical Equipment (QPME) label will be used if available. - **NRMM Label:** Only plant with Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) label will be used unless exempted. - **Chemical Management:** All chemicals will be placed on a drip tray to prevent spillage. - **Wastewater Management:** Any wastewater produced during the work will be treated prior to disposal. - **Environmental Permit Compliance:** The works shall follow relevant mitigation measures as required under the Environmental Permit (EP) / EP submission and Contractor's Environmental Management Plan (EMP).",
        "11. Quality Control": "To ensure the attainment of the required standard of works, the following quality control measures will be implemented: - **Inspection and Test Plan (ITP):** Refer to Appendix B for the ITP. The methods of working and the required work standards/acceptance criteria are defined in the method statement and ITP. - **Routine Inspections:** Day-to-day routine inspections of the works will be carried out by the Construction Team Leader, Site Engineers, and Foreman to ensure compliance with the method statement and ITP. - **Hold Points and Witness Points:** Specific quality checks shall be carried out in accordance with the approved ITP with \"Hold Points\" at critical elements for confirmation of compliance before proceeding further. - **Request for Inspection and Survey Check (RISC):** RISC shall be issued to the Resident Site Staff (RSS) following inspection of the works by the CSHK's project team. - **Inspection Records:** As each inspection and test is completed, records will be prepared to indicate whether the specified requirements have been met. These records will be maintained and kept available for inspection and final handover.",
        "12. Appendices": "The following appendices are included in the submission package: - **Appendix A:** Risk Assessment - **Appendix B:** Inspection and Test Plan (ITP) - **Appendix C:** Drawings - **Appendix D:** Emergency Contact List --- This document is controlled in soft copy. Any hard copies seen are uncontrolled unless chopped with a red control stamp. --- **中國建築工程（香港）有限公司** **CHINA STATE CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING (HONG KONG) LIMITED** --- This concludes the method statement for the installation of the Railway Protection (RP) fence at the West Depot Entry Track (WDET).
