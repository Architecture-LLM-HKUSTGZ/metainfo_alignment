        "5. **Programme and Working Hours**": "The general working hours will be 08:00 – 18:00 daily, from Monday to Saturday. However, it may be required to carry out works from 18:00 to 23:00 and Sundays and Public Holidays in case of essential speeding up of the working process. CSHK would check internally to fulfil the Construction Noise Permit Requirement. - The maximum permitted barge movements allowed in accordance with the approved Environmental Review Report (ERR) issued by EPD is 6 trips per day and 7 days per week (i.e. Maximum 42 trips per week) from mid-2024 to end of Year 2027 for the depot construction. - Average number of barge trips per day will be: - 3 barges for pre-cast units, - 2 barges for steel and rebar - 1 barge for the excavation material The 6 barges will replace about 65 construction vehicles per day that would be required for land-based transportation. All the works within OA Area shall be supervised by a CP(T)/CP(NT) during the approved working period.",
        "6. **Plant, Equipment & Material**": "All plant and equipment will be inspected prior to mobilization on site to ensure that they are in good working condition and comply with all current regulations. The major plant and equipment that will be deployed to carry out the works are as follows: ### Plant / Equipment used for Precast Beam/Slab Delivery Operation | Vessel Type         | Tentative Size (Overall Length x Breadth x Draft) | |---------------------|--------------------------------------------------| | Delivery Barge      | 49m x 15m x 3.5m                                 | | Crane Barge         | S.W.L.: 200 tons. 50m x 25m x 1.5m               | | Heavy Lifting Barge | 61.2m x 21.3m x 2.8m                             | | Supporting Vessel: Tugboat | 21.3m x 6.6m x 1.8m                       | | Guard Boat / Rescue Boat | 61.2m x 21.3m x 2.8m                        | ### Plant / Equipment used for Disposal of C&D materials | Vessel Type         | Typical Size (Overall Length x Breadth x Draft)  | |---------------------|--------------------------------------------------| | RoRo Barge with Tipping Hall | 41.9m x 18.3m x 1.2m                    | | Hopper Barge       | 55.5m x 21.7m x 3m                                |",
        "7. **Construction Methods / Construction Sequence**": "### 7.0 Existing Vertical Seawall The seawall is located at the north side of Siu Ho Wan depot. - The overall length of this vertical seawall: ~ 140 m - Constructed with precast concrete blocks - Toe level is -5.5 mPD ### 7.1 Use of Seawall The seawall will be used for material delivery to site, such as precast materials and DfMA modules, and material disposal offsite, such as C&D materials. The precast materials will mainly be delivered to W11. Also, the C&D materials will mainly be excavated from W11. ### 7.2 Traffic Arrangements from W11 to Seawall through VAB To facilitate the traffic arrangement between W11 and the vertical seawall, the traffic routing from W11 to the seawall is shown in the following figures. There are 2 routings which are for shorter vehicles (below 12m) and longer vehicles (12m to 18m) respectively. The tentative dump truck traffic volume at the barging point will be 12 dump trucks per hour. The traffic routing from W11 to the seawall for longer vehicles (12m to 18m) is proposed in order to avoid using the existing depot road to the West of AB1 and to minimize the use of the main depot road, such that we do not affect the MTR depot daily operation and the operation of the MTR shuttle bus stop. The use of the existing west level crossing or level crossings at the east side of the main building is required to allow the long vehicles to deliver to Works Area W11 as they are unable to turn around to access the Works Area via the temporary vehicular bridge when leaving the seawall. The traffic routing utilizes the water-filled barriers to reduce the traffic arms. The level crossing located east of the main building can be used occasionally for special cases. However, MTR does not recommend CSHK to use it frequently. Therefore, MTR advised CSHK to adopt the routing passing through the west level crossing. A CP(T) escort shall be provided and CSHK shall maintain the 4m permissible height rule when using the level crossings. The swept path analysis for this routing is included in the Traffic Management Plan (Main Stage) under separate submission. ### 7.3 Seawall Gate Arrangement For the seawall gate arrangements, please refer to the Traffic Management Plan (Main Stage) under separate submission. CSHK will provide CCTV at the seawall access gates to allow depot staff to monitor the seawall site condition. ### 7.4 Joint Use of Seawall with CEDD Contract C7 Contract C7 is currently utilizing the seawall for their construction works. CSHK is required to liaise with CEDD to arrange joint use of the seawall. According to Contract C7, they will utilise the seawall until the end of 2024. For the booking arrangements of the seawall with the depot and Contract C7, please refer to the separate submission ‘Method Statement of Disposal of C&D materials’. ### 7.7 Material Delivery #### 7.7.1 Estimation of Material Required for Delivery The following is the estimation of materials to be delivered via marine transportation: 1. Steel trusses for the construction of the OYB Link Bridges. 2. Precast I-beams for L-Shape Link Bridge construction and precast RC units for Phase 3D Sewerage Deck construction - Total 8 nos. of Precast I-Beams 3. Precast RC beams and slabs for OYB construction - Over 370 nos. of pre-cast U-shaped beam shells - Over 1000 nos. of pre-cast slabs 4. Phase 3D Sewerage Deck construction - 101 nos. of precast RC units #### 7.7.2 Delivery Schedule The precast components will be delivered to site for assembly, including beams and slabs, starting from Feb 2025 to 2027 tentatively. The estimated delivery schedule of the precast components is shown in the figure below: There are two main components of precast: | Component | Period for Delivery | Max Dimension for Planning Purpose | Total | |-----------|---------------------|------------------------------------|-------| | Beam      | February 2025 - April 2027 | 3.2m wide * 4.25m deep * 26.3m long | 185   | | Slab      | February 2025 - April 2027 | 1.2m wide * 0.5m (deep T) * 10m long | 3200  | #### 7.7.3 Unloading of material from barge - The process of unloading materials from a barge involves transferring goods or supplies from the barge to a designated location on land. This can be accomplished using various methods and equipment, depending on the type of cargo and the available infrastructure. - A crane is positioned on the dock or shoreline, and it utilizes a lifting mechanism and cables to hoist the cargo from the barge and place it onto the designated area. The crane operator carefully maneuvers the cargo, following specific instructions and safety protocols. - Where large quantities of construction materials, such as steel beams or concrete blocks, need to be unloaded from a barge. A crane with a suitable lifting capacity is positioned on the dock adjacent to the barge. The crane operator communicates with the crew on the barge, who attach the cargo to be unloaded to the crane's lifting hook. The crane operator then operates the crane, lifting the materials from the barge and placing them onto the long vehicle. #### 7.7.4 Berthing Arrangement for Material Delivery on-site For transporting of precast materials, a Derrick Lighter will transport the construction materials to the Site via marine access. The proposed berthing arrangement is as shown in the Figure below: - 2 vessels can be accommodated at the barging facility concurrently. One can berth at the seawall for loading/unloading operations whilst the 2nd vessel will be berthed at the Spoil removal barge for disposal of excavated materials.",
        "8. **Safety**": "### 8.1 General Safety - All workers shall attend a site-specific induction course conducted by CSHK Safety Team.

        "9. **Environmental**": "Environmental aspect & impact identification as well as mitigation measures will be addressed in this section. The works shall follow relevant mitigation measures as required under the Environmental Permit (EP) / EP submission and Contractor’s Environmental Management Plan (EMP). ### 9.0 General Mitigation Measures - General works shall be carried out during normal working hours (08:00 to 18:00). However, should the progress demand for the works to be undertaken from 19:00 to 07:00 next day or on public holidays, a construction noise permit shall be obtained as necessary. - Plant with QPME label will be deployed if available. - Only plant with NRMM label will be used unless exempted. - For disposal of C&D materials, water spray will be carried out during the work to prevent dust generation. - C&D material for disposal will be water sprayed to suppress dust. - Wheel-washing facilities should be provided at the exits from work areas. A hard-surfaced road between any washing facility and the public road should also be provided. - Regular watering of active works areas, exposed areas, and paved haul roads. - Drip tray should be provided to chemical waste containers. The drip tray should be cleaned up regularly. Clean up should be done before foreseeable inclement weather such as typhoon or heavy rain. ### 9.1 Mitigate the Risks Associated with Dust Pollution - The application of water to suppress dust by maintaining moisture in the soil and materials, the utilization of covers such as tarps or other appropriate materials to prevent the escape of dust during transportation. - The implementation of controls during the dumping process to regulate the speed and height of dumping, site preparation activities such as watering or the application of dust suppressant chemicals, and regular monitoring of the site and its surrounding areas to promptly detect and address any dust-related concerns that may arise. ### 9.2 Mitigation Measures for Potential Water Quality Impacts As the barging point is located near to the Brothers Marine Park, the following good site practices should be implemented to minimize the potential water quality impact due to the usage of the barging point: - Wastewater shall be collected within the site and would not discharge to the sea. - All vessels shall be sized so that adequate clearance is maintained between vessels and the seabed in all tide conditions, to ensure that undue turbidity is not generated by turbulence from vessel movement or propeller wash. - Loading of barges shall be controlled to prevent the splashing of material into the surrounding water. - Barges shall not be filled to a level which will cause overflow of materials or pollution of water during loading or transportation. - Excess materials shall be cleaned from the decks and exposed fittings of barges before the vessels are moved. - Adequate freeboard shall be maintained on barges to reduce the likelihood of decks being washed by wave action.",
        "10. **Quality Control**": "The use of the vertical seawall does not form part of the permanent works construction and therefore an Inspection and Test Plan (ITP) is not relevant for this Method Statement and is not provided.",
