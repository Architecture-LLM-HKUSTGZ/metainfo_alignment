    "1.13.76 (CS) Method Statement for Resurfacing of Asphalt Road at Elevated Shun Long Road (Fast Lane)": {
        "1. Introduction": "In accordance with Project Managers Instruction (PMI) No. 12 resurfacing of the friction course of the elevated Shun Long Road fast lane is required as requested by the Highways department (HyD). A total length of 40m of friction course is to be resurfaced as shown in Figure 1 below. The resurfacing work will be carried out during night closures of both the slow and fast lanes of Shun Long Road with traffic diverted in accordance with the approved TTA scheme. The re-surfacing of the slow lane will be undertaken at a later stage and will be subject to a separate method statement submission. This method statement describes the method and sequence of the re-surfacing of the friction course and wearing course for the fast lane only as well as the implementation of the associated TTM. The re-surfacing work is outside of the SHD Operational Areas (OAs).

        "7. Construction Methods / Construction Sequence": "### 7.1 Preparation work before TTM Implementation Prior to commencement of the re-surfacing work, preparation of the road closure and TTM plan is required. As per the TTM plan (refer to appendix C), temporary road signage is to be installed and several existing signs leading from the Sky City Interchange to be modified. To maximize the available working hours for the road re-surfacing work, all temporary signage will be installed in advance of road closure and covered by black plastic sheet which will be removed as the TTA is installed. In this TTM scheme, the entire length of the elevated Shun Long Road Westbound to Kowloon will be closed from 22:00 to 06:00. During this closure, all traffic from Chek Lap Kok road towards Kowloon will be diverted to the Eastbound carriageway of the Lantau Highway to Tung Chung East Interchange to then turn back onto the Westbound carriageway towards Kowloon. The existing TTA water filled barrier at the existing site entrance on Shun Long Road may be partially removed to allow for mobilization of plant during the works. The TTM water filled barrier will be reinstated prior to re-opening of the road. ### 7.2 TTM Implementation The closure of Shun Long Road will commence at 22:30 subject to acceptable traffic flows to allow the road closure to be implemented. All temporary signage shall be uncovered by 22:30. A Traffic Mounted Attenuator (TMA) with FAS will be positioned at the front of the merge point of the road, as shown in the above sketch, to protect the workers during placing of the traffic cone to implement the road closure. A traffic marshall will be provided to guide the road user to the diversion route. Implementation of the TTA road closure is planned to be complete by 23:00. Traffic Marshalls will open the cones locally at the road closure to allow construction vehicles to enter the works site.",
        "7.3 Resurfacing work": "From 23:00 to 05:00, re-surfacing work will be carried out on the elevated Shun Long Road. The work comprises of the following steps: **Step 1:** Set out of the extent of the asphalt to be removed, starting 10.9m east of the bridge abutment for a length of 40m west (refer to figure.1 for details). The full width of the fast lane from the existing parapet to the road centre line shall be removed in accordance with the relevant guidance note. **Step 2:** Mobilize all the asphalt plant inside the existing TTM entrance near W1. **Step 3:** Cold Planer to mill down the 30 mm thk. friction course and 45~50mm wearing course. The horizontal, longitudinal and lapping joint will be saw-cut and broke. A road washing truck will clean out all the bituminous debris prior to application of the tack coat. **Step 4:** Asphalt workers will mark out the wearing course and finishing level of the road as per the as-built level provided by Hyd. Tack coat must be applied evenly on the base course and concrete profile barrier/parapet which will be in-contact with the bitumen to ensure bonding of the bitumen. **Step 5:** Load the paving machine with bitumen and check the temperature of the fresh bitumen as laid prior to compaction (for the temperature required at laying for the polymer modified friction course and wearing course, refer to the manufacturers specification). The paver shall lay in one direction with the loading truck in front, laying of east to west is preferred. The level of the wearing course can be adjusted using the paver screed. Each run will cover the full width of a single lane. The longitudinal joint shall be formed coincident with the location of the white lining. Bulk samples shall be taken from the loading truck directly for testing. Core sample is not required for PMFC, required for wearing course with minimum 2 nos. as required from Hyd. **Step 6:** The wearing course will be compacted by a vibratory tandem steel-wheeled roller with a mass between 6T to 12T in the longitudinal direction. For PMFC, a pneumatic-tyre roller shall not be used for compaction. Where the bitumen is laid adjacent to kerbs, covers and frames where rollers cannot operate effectively, these areas shall be compacted using hand-operated mechanical compaction. **Step 7:** After compaction of the wearing course is completed, repeat the laying and compaction steps for polymer modified friction course. Tack coat is not required between wearing & friction course if the laying is within a few hours, as stated in RN/GN/039 p.19. **Step 8:** Road marking team set out the road marking on road. Reinstatement of road marking shall refer to the Transport Planning & Design Manual Volume 3 clause 5.4.2.3. For a speed limit of 70km/h or more, RM1102 shall be used for the middle lane line marking. For the hard shoulder, RM1109 shall be used. Road studs to be reinstated as per figure.13. **Step 9:** Final inspection of the road before removal of TTM. **Step 10:** As-built readings taken for reinstated friction road at day-time. ### 7.4 Road opening After the bitumen and road marking are complete, site clearance and inspection will be conducted to check and remove any leftover objects or debris which may jeopardize the traffic users. A final clean of the road using the road brush will be completed prior to re-opening the road. TTM teams will be used to remove the TTM and temporary signage. Once the TTM is removed, the signage can be reinstated or removed. The road will be re-opened at 05:00.",
        "8. Safety": "The Risk Assessment attached in Appendix A has been prepared for all general activities. Specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow. The Construction Team Leader together with the RSO, will supervise the implementation and make adjustment according to the actual site operations, in order to maintain a safe and amicable working environment. ### 9. Environmental Works will be carried out during an overnight road closure of Shun Long Road from 22:30 to 05:00, provisionally scheduled to commence on Friday 12th July 2024. The works will only be carried out when the CNP or EO for the road re-surfacing at the elevated Shun Long Road is granted. - ULSD diesel will be used in all PME. - Plant with QPME label will be employed, if available. - All chemicals will be placed on drip trays. - The works shall follow relevant mitigation measures as required under the Environmental Permit (EP)/ EP submission and Contractor's Environmental Management Plan (EMP).",
        "10. Quality Control": "Refer to Appendix B for Inspection and Test Plan. To ensure the attainment of the required standard of works, the methods of working and the required works standards/acceptance criteria are defined in the method statement, inspection & test plans, and are communicated to relevant staff and workers carrying out the works. Day to day routine inspections of the works will be carried out by the Construction Team Leader, Site Engineers and Foreman as appropriate, to ensure that all works are performed following the requirements of these documents. Specific quality checks shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Inspection & Test Plan with \"Hold Points\" at critical elements for confirmation of compliance before proceeding further. The Inspection & Test Plan for the works (Appendix B) will identify all Hold Points and Witness Points. Following the Inspection & Test carried out, inspection and/or test records are to be prepared to indicate whether the specified requirements have been met. Records of Inspection and testing will be maintained and kept available for inspection and final handover as appropriate.",
