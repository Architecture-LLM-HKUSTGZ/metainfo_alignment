        "5. Programme and Working Hours (Start & finish date of operation/works)": "CCTV camera installation and testing works will be commenced on early March, 2024.",
        "6. Plant, Equipment & Material (Identify type, model and specification of MAJOR plant & equipment)": "All plants and equipment will be inspected prior to the mobilization on site to ensure that they are in good working condition and comply with the current regulations. The major plants and equipment will be deployed to carry out the works are as follow: ### Plant/ Equipment - Cherry Picker: 1 - Hand held electric batch: 2 ### Manpower - Skill labor: 3 - Electrician: 2 - Plant Operator: 1 - Banksman: 1 - Foreman: 1",
        "7. Construction Methods / Construction Sequence Drawings": "### 7.1 Introduction Two types of CCTV will be adopted for 1701: The mobile solar power CCTV camera and fix mount solar power CCTV camera. All the CCTV camera could be access through the C-SMART platform except for the re-provision CCTV to deport. The Overall CCTV layout plan is attached in Appendix B. ### 7.2 CCTV Installation Method #### 7.2.1 Installation of Mobile Solar Power CCTV Camera Stand Trolley for Mobile Solar Powered CCTV, Size (H)93cm x (W)70cm x (D)40cm. The mobile solar power CCTV camera will be assembled and installed out of site which include: - Single Color Logo (Blue Color) - Hydraulic Pole from 1.5 meter to 3.5 meter x 2 nos - Solar Plate x 2 nos - Inverter x 1 nos - DC12V 200A Lithium Battery x 1 nos The maximum height of mobile solar power CCTV camera is 3.5m. #### 7.2.2 Installation of Fix Mounted Solar Power CCTV camera **Step 1: Install the SIM Card** (Required when using a CCTV with a SIM card.) Loosen the 2 screws at the bottom of the CCTV, open the card cover, and gently insert the SIM card according to the direction indicated by the notch. After that, re-tighten the 2 screws at the bottom of the camera to complete the installation. **Step 2: Choose the right mounting point** The first step is to survey the site and find a suitable point for CCTV installation. Selection of points generally have the following principles: - Installation angle as far as possible so that the area to be monitored falls within the scope of the camera focus clear; - Installation height will exceed the height of the human body, to avoid too low to be man-made damage, too high to be bad maintenance; **Step 3: Install the camera and solar panel** The CCTV is mounted directly on the lamp pole or concrete blocks with pole. Generally, the height of CCTV mounted on the lamp pole will be 6m and to be installed by aid of cherry picker. The height of CCTV mounted on a concrete block with pole would be 3m to be installed by aid of platform ladder. Install solar panel by using the hexagonal wrench to fix the solar panel on the support arm. Mount camera by using two screws to fix the camera to the bracket first. Then pass the hoop through the pole and tighten the hoop screws to secure the bracket to the pole. Loosen vertical and horizontal adjustment screws, adjust the camera to desired scene to be monitored, tighten the adjustment screws, and complete the installation. ### 7.2.3 Network connection of solar panel CCTV camera **(1) General Network Connection System** According to the existing CCTV layout plan, the wireless network linking could be achieved by using Leap X, Network Receiver and Wireless Bridge. The fundamental topology theory of the network is similar as tree diagram: 1. The network of the whole system is received by Network Receiver then transit to relatively nearer wireless bridge and CCTV camera via cable/fiber. 2. The network of further Leap X and CCTV/C-Smart camera will be linked by the signal of wireless bridge via cable/fiber. 3. The rest of CCTV/C-Smart cameras are going to link to network by 5.8G Leap X network. The following is the draft network connection system for 1701. **Alternative Network Connection** For those area couldnâ€™t connect to the network system, SIM card(s) will be adopted with the following specification or similar to the CCTV camera(s). - 250GB 5G (FUP CDP) + [bundle] Peplink BR1 + Fixed IP",
        "8. Safety (Risk Assessments)": "Risk Assessment attached in Appendix A has been prepared for all general activities. Specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow. The Construction Team Leader together with the RSO, will supervise the implementation and make adjustment according to the actual site operations, in order to maintain a safe and amicable working environment.",
        "9. Environmental (Environmental aspect & impact identification as well as mitigation measures)": "The following mitigation measures will be followed: - General works shall be carried out during normal hours from 08:00 am to 07:00 pm. No works will be carried out after 07:00 pm on Sunday or public holiday without approval construction noise permit. - Plant with QPME label will be employed, if available. - NRMM Label will be affixed to PME as required.",
        "10. Quality Control (Inspection and Test Plan including hold points)": "Inspection and Test Plan (N/A).",
        "11. Appendices (Identify and include additional information in the submission package)": "- Appendix A - Risk Assessment - Appendix B - Catalogue for Equipment - Appendix C - Layout Plan - Appendix D - Emergency Contact List - Appendix E - Inspection and Test Plan (N/A) ```"
