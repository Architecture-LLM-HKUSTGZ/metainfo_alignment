        "7. Construction Methods / Construction Sequence": "### 7.1.1 Before carrying out construction works, the area will be fenced off as per the approved method statement, Installation of Water Filled Barrier at W3 and W7 Erection of Container and Site Office at W7 Site Clearance at W3 (ACC Reference Number: 1701/W/000/CSC/000053). The details can be found below. The access point is also shown in the below figure. ### 7.1.2 Site clearance for above ground will be carried out with the use of grab lorry, as per the approved method statement, Installation of Water Filled Barrier at W3 and W7 Erection of Container and Site Office at W7 Site Clearance at W3 (ACC Reference Number: 1701/W/000/CSC/000053). ### 7.2 Utilities detection Utilities detection and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey will be carried out after the area was fenced off and after the obstacle above ground are cleared. The details of carrying out utilities detection shall follow the approved Method Statement for General Underground Utility Survey for Construction Area (ACC Reference Number: 1701/W/000/CSC/760/000095). Based on the master drawings of all utilities, it shows that only one cable in this area. ### 7.3 Breaking Existing Concrete and Trial Trench (if necessary) #### 7.3.1 Breaking the existing concrete with the use of excavator and hydraulic breaker. As per the approved method statement, Installation of Water Filled Barrier at W3 and W7 Erection of Container and Site Office at W7 Site Clearance at W3 (ACC Reference Number: 1701/W/000/CSC/000053). #### 7.3.2 If there are no underground utilities along the sheet pile location in Temporary Underfloor Wheel Lathe, trial trench will not be carried out after the blinding concrete is broken. If there are any underground utilities within the sheet pile area, the trial trench is 500mm width x 2.5m depth will be carried out. For this situation, the underground utilities survey report stated that no existing underground utilities within this construction area. The underground utilities survey report was submitted (ACC Ref.: 1701-W-000-CSC-810-000257), and attached in Appendix P for reference. ### 7.4 Abandoned existing utility by other contract 1732 #### 7.4.1 No Underground utility diversion will be carried out within the location of the Temporary Underfloor Wheel Lathe. Referring to RFI 004(Temporary Underfloor Wheel Lathe –Obstruction of Existing Antenna Tower and Diversion details of existing E&M Drawpits)(attached in Appendix L) response from MTR, one existing cable (highlighted in yellow) and drawpit are within this construction area of sheet pile will be abandoned by Contract 1732. ### 7.5 Instrumentation and Monitoring Plan #### 7.5.1 Setting up instrumentation monitoring plan and taking initial readings as per the working drawings 1701–W–SHD–OAP–C06–051 and 1701–W–SHD–OAP–C06–052 attached in Appendix I. The method statement for setting up instrumentation monitoring will be under a separate submission, which is Method Statement for Instrumentation and Monitoring Works at Operations Area (OA) (ACC Reference Number 1701/W/000/CSC/760/000122) and Method Statement for Instrumentation and Monitoring Works at Construction Area (CA) (ACC Reference Number 1701/W/000/CSC/760/000138). For those works on the existing live track, another document Edoc will be submitted to the Railway and Protection Department. For those standpipe and piezometer, it will be installed at the location which are 10 meters far away form the existing live tracks. #### 7.5.2 AAA Levels will be used for the monitoring works in drawings no.C1701/B/SHD/OAPMC06/011, Geotechnical Instrumentation and Monitoring General Notes (AB22T) (For non-railway structures), and C1701/B/SHD/OAPMC06/012, Geotechnical Instrumentation and Monitoring General Notes (AB22T) (For railway structures) **THE MOVEMENT AND VIBRATION LIMITS SHALL BE THOSE STIPULATED IN TABLE BELOW.** **MOVEMENT LIMITS IN TABLE BELOW IS FOR THE ACCUMULATED MOVEMENT OF ALL ACTIVITIES ON SITE.** | MONITORING STATION | ALERT | ALARM | ACTION | | ------------------ | ----- | ----- | ------ | | GROUND SETTLEMENT (GS601-GS609) | 12mm | 18mm | 25mm | | STANDPIPE AND PIEZOMETER (SP601 TO | 0.5m | 0.7m | 1m | | UTILITY SETTLEMENT (UMP601 TO UMP618) | 12m | 18m | 25m | NOTE: THE AAA LEVELS SHALL BE MEASURED FROM THE LOWEST MEASURED HISTORICAL GROUNDWATER RECORD (i.e.+1.36mPD). #### 7.5.3 A monitoring sequence can be found and will be used for the monitoring works in drawings no. C1701/B/SHD/OAP/C06/011, Geotechnical Instrumentation and Monitoring General Notes (AB22T) (For non-railway structures), and C1701/B/SHD/OAP/C06/012,Geotechnical Instrumentation and Monitoring General Notes (AB22T) (For railway structures) **MONITORING FREQUENCY (EXCEPT MTR STRUCTURES)** | INSTRUMENT TYPE | DEPTH | PURPOSE | MINIMUM FREQUENCY OF MONITORING | | --------------- | ----- | ------- | ------------------------------- | | GROUND SETTLEMENT MARKER | ON GROUND SURFACE | TO MONITOR GROUND SETTLEMENT | MONTHLY | WEEKLY | DAILY | | UTILITY SETTLEMENT MARKER | ON SELECTED UTILITIES | TO MONITOR UTILITY | MONTHLY | WEEKLY | DAILY | | GROUND WATER MONITORING | ON GROUND SURFACE | TO MONITOR GROUND WATER LEVEL | MONTHLY | WEEKLY | DAILY | **MONITORING FREQUENCY (FOR MTR STRUCTURES)** | INSTRUMENT TYPE | DEPTH | PURPOSE | MINIMUM FREQUENCY OF MONITORING | | --------------- | ----- | ------- | ------------------------------- | | BUILDING SETTLEMENT MARKER | ON SELECTED BUILDING & STRUCTURES | TO MONITOR BUILDING STRUCTURES | MONTHLY | WEEKLY | DAILY | | TILT PLATE | ON SELECTED BUILDING & STRUCTURES | TO MONITOR TILTING OF STRUCTURES | MONTHLY | WEEKLY | DAILY | | VIBRATION MONITORING | ON SELECTED BUILDING & STRUCTURES | TO MONITOR VIBRATION | MONTHLY | WEEKLY | DAILY | | SETTLEMENT MONITORING AT RAILWAY STRUCTURES | ON EXISTING TRACK & RAILWAY STRUCTURES | TO MONITOR STRUCTURE MOVEMENT | MONTHLY | WEEKLY | DAILY | ### 7.6.1 The lifting procedure will be suspended when there is a train passing through the existing TUFWL trackwork. ### 7.6.2 All lifting works with Crane will be placed on the location which is at least 28 meters (ie. 22.3 lifting radius in Appendix D and 6.7 meter away from OHL post counting from the closest distance in Page 7 of this Method Statement) away from the OHL post with the use of an angle lock, so as to minimise the effect on OHL Post or consequence of any accident of lifting works. The detailed lifting plan is attached in Appendix D. ### 7.6.3 Welding works will be carried out for this construction work. All equipment will be placed in a designated location for these dangerous goods. The maximum quantity of the acetylene cylinder is 4 and no smoking is allowed near that storage area. The location will be coordinated with MTR representatives in W3A zone for ensuring it can fulfil the storage requirement.",
