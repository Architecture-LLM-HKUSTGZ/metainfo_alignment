    "1.13.38 (CS) Method Statement for Temporary Widening at Sham Shui Kok Drive": {
        "1. Introduction": "This Method Statement is a safety working method & procedures document describing the health, safety, environment & quality requirements for the temporary widening of existing SSK Drive to facilitate 2-lanes traffic. The proposed extension of widening covers 180m from the SHD East Gate towards the East. The methodologies of elimination, mitigation, and control of risks shall be addressed. Based on the current latest survey result, the proposed extent of temporary widening will be up to approx. 180m, which can provide sufficient lane width for 2-lanes traffic. For the remaining portions in SSK Drive, further coordination is needed with Contract C7, e.g., relocation of materials, to facilitate the temporary widening.",

        "6. Works Methodology": "### 6.1 Preparation Works #### UU Detection Works at Verge Area Refer to separation submission under 1701-W-000-CSC-760-000095. The existing UU will be detected and recorded in layout plan. Appropriate tools for handling the plank cover should be utilized. #### Site Clearance Works at Verge Area Refer to separation submission under 1701-W-000-CSC-760-000177. The weeds within the verge area will be removed by hand tools, grab lorry by portions. Proposed work division along SSK Drive for site clearance. ### 6.2 Detailed of Temporary Widening #### 6.2.1 General The widening of SSK Drive will be divided in portions, with approx. length of 30m, subject to site conditions. #### 6.2.2 Excavation and Preparation for concrete block placing (Portions 1-6) Survey reference marks will be provided on site to define the excavation level. 3-tons excavator is used to excavate and prepare surface for concrete block placing within the verge area. For area adjacent to the RP fencing, preparation by hand tool is needed. The excavator will be located on flat ground to prevent overturn. The work will be carried out portions by portions, approximately 30m per portion, depends on the actual site conditions. After completion of formation, blinding layer will be casted with approx. 75mm thick. For procedure of casting floor blinding, please refer to Appendix G. #### 6.2.3 Concrete block placing by Crane Lorry / Mini Crawler Crane – site setting up layout for Portion 1 - Crane lorry / Mini Crawler Crane will occupy the SSK drive partly during the lifting operation. - Coordination with Contract C7 and Depot area will be arranged prior to start. - The works will be carried out portions by portions, approximately 30m per portion, depends on the actual site conditions. - For concrete block placing and interlocking, temporary work inspection should be arranged with TWC before backfilling around the verge area. - The steel pole and wire mesh fencing should be installed concurrently after a portion of blocks are in position, e.g., 15m extent. - Briefing to workers will be conducted to prevent unauthorized entry to track area. #### 6.2.4 Concrete block placing by Crane Lorry / Mini Crawler Crane – site setting up layout for Portion 2-6 - With the completion of portion 1 backfilling with compaction, the crane lorry / Mini Crawler Crane will be set up for the next portion. - The widening and backfilling works along the 180m extent will be carried out by portions. #### 6.2.5 Sequence of Concrete block placing and U-channel installation - Concrete block placed will be interconnected by U-channel, fixed by bolts. - Approximate 3 blocks will be connected as a group. #### 6.2.6 Backfilling at verge area - After completion of block installation and interlocking by U-channel, the remaining verge area will be backfilled with compaction. - The backfilling work will be demarcated within the verge area. - Backfilled by excavator, the formation will be compacted by vibrating compactor. - Reference mark will be provided during backfilling. #### 6.2.7 Installation of Wire Mesh - Materials for the wire mesh fencing rail will be delivered on site for site installation. - Wire mesh material will be erected and installed by manual handling through bolts and nuts connection.
