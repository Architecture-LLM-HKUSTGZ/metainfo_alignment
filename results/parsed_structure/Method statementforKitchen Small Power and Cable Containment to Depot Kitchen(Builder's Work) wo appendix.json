Catalogue, installation manual refer to Appendix H. ### 7.3 Formation of Flooring Opening (Using Coring Machine) \"Permit to drill/core\" shall be implemented before using coring machine. (Blanked form refer to Appendix J) Before any drilling works, cover meter/wall scanner will be applied to confirm the absence of concealed or cast-in conduits or items inside the slab or wall before drilling. Please refer to the guideline and general procedure listed below for applying Cover Meter/Wall Scanner: 1. Ensure the device is properly calibrated and the user is familiar with the device. 2. Set out the drilling point; and mark the scanning area (around 400 x 400mm from the boundary of the drilling point) 3. Clear the drilling area of any obstructions and debris. Ensure that the surface is clean and accessible for the cover meter to make accurate measurements. 4. Select the suitable type according to the wall type or slab to be inspected. Details can refer to the user manual as attached. 5. Place the cover meter probe against the surface of the wall or slab and move it systematically across the drilling area (~400 x 400mm in order to have an accuracy result). Follow a grid pattern to ensure comprehensive coverage. 6. Cover meter will project the result, if there is any concealed conduits detected, to determine another drilling point and repeat the step 1 to step 6 again. 7. Remove the debris and clean the floor surface. 8. Use a cover meter/ wall scanner to determine the rebar location (Catalogue and user manual refer to Appendix K, Guide line refer to the above paragraph). 9. Position the coring machine. 10. Mark the desired drilling depth on the core bit. 11. In order to prevent water seepage from the opening during coring, the desired drilling depth shall be the concrete slab thickness minus 20mm. 12. Start coring and maintain a slow speed until reaching the desired drilling depth. 13. Remove all water surrounding the opening. 14. Use a hand driller / breaker to remove the R.C. segment. 15. During Coring Floor Opening, the following protection works shall be done: - Position a bucket directly below the intended opening to collect water during coring. - Provide site supervisor to keep close monitoring and promptly inform workers to halt the works in the event of any unforeseen circumstances. ### 7.4 Formation of Wall Opening (Drywall) - Identify the location of existing concealed conduit and wall stud inside drywall by wall scanner; (Refer to the guideline listed under Section 7.3) - Mark the desired location of the opening on the drywall panel (both sides of wall panel); - Use angle grinder to cut along the marked lines until the opening is formed; - Remove the rockwool inside drywall; - Use angle grinder to cut another side of the wall panel until the opening is formed. ### 7.5 Formation of Wall Opening (R.C. Wall) - Use a cover meter to determine the rebar/ concealed conduits location; (Refer to the guideline listed under Section 7.3) - Determine and mark the desired location of the openings; - Use hand drill tools to form a ~10mm dia. trial drill on the wall to confirm the exact location of wall opening and wall thickness; - Position the coring machine at the staircase side; - Mark the desired drilling depth on the core bit; - The desired drilling depth shall be the wall thickness minus 20mm; - Start coring and maintain a slow speed until reaching the desired drilling depth; - Use a hand driller / breaker to remove the R.C. segment. ### 7.6 Formation of Opening on False Ceiling Panel - Identify the location of ceiling gird by wall scanner; (Refer to the guideline listed under Section 7.3) - Mark the desired location of the opening on the false ceiling; - Confirm the setting-out is correct by CSHK/BS; - Cut along the marked lines carefully with angle grinder until the opening is formed. ### 7.7 Make Good of wall and floor opening after installation of cable trunks - Identify the wall or floor finishes; - Thoroughly apply firestop sealant to fill the gap between cable tray and the drywall panel; - If the gap is larger than 30mm, non-shrink grout will be used instead; - For paint finish, apply skim coat & wall paint finish if necessary; - For tile finish, laying new wall ceramic tiles. ### 7.8 Open up the drywall panels and restore it after E&M’s installation - Dismantle the existing drywall panels; - Remove the rockwool inside; - Install angle brackets, unistrut, cable tray and cabling works (By BS Contractor); - Re-install the drywall panel/ replace a new drywall panel. ### 7.9 Modification of existing curb to fit the E&M’s installation - Mark the boundary of curb to be modified; - Remove the required section of curb: - Examine the curb to determine its construction such as any rebar inside; - Use a jack hammer to demolish the curb; - Mark the setting-out of new curb; - Construct a wooden formwork along the new curb; - Mix the cement sand mixture thoroughly in a mixing container with 1:3:0.5 cement sand water ratio; - Pour the cement sand mixture into the formwork; - Use a trowel to shape and smooth the mixture; - Curing and remove the wooden formwork when it is fully dried.",
