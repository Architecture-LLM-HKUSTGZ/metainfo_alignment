        "7. Construction Methods / Construction Sequence Drawings": "### 1. Methodology of temporary sewage treatment and diversion A temporary drainage proposal, including how the sewerage would be collected, conveyed and discharged to the site, would be submitted to DSD to demonstrate that the proposed use of the site would not have adverse drainage impacts on the drainage issue to the area. Upon the satisfactory drainage submission approved by DSD, the proposed drainage facilities as per our submissions shall be implemented and completed as soon as possible. In general, a surface channel at the peripheral of the site should be constructed to intercept all such rain water falling onto the site. U-channel shall be located on the lower side to collect rain water from the site. Then sewage water/stormwater shall be collected by pump into catch pit (UU detection should be carried out before excavation for placing pre-cast catch pit), and “AquaSed” shall be equipped in every local area for sedimentation and treatment. We would take advantage of existing public drainage system by diverting wastewater/stormwater into manholes and gullies to discharge them. The flow chart of overall treatment process may refer to Figure 1.1. ### 2. Checking of drainage for temporary purposes a. The capacities of the existing drainage affected by the discharge of the additional construction generated waste water will be considered as an impact to the existing system and checked for the maximum capacity. The capacity calculation under review and will supplement later. b. The temporary drainage arrangement will be designed in accordance with DSD Technical Circular No. 1/2017 to ensure that the additional capacity as well as the surface run-off does not incur any adverse impact to the existing drainage system. c. There will be no significant alternation to the drainage pattern while treated water will be discharged to existing drainage system. d. The temporary drainage diversion will be checked and designed from time to time to suit the site activities. e. The sizes of existing drainage or permanent drainage pipelines designed by the Engineer form the basis to determine the minimum temporary pipeline sizes at the concerned locations. ### 3. Proposed temporary drainage arrangement The overall arrangement layout refers to Figure 1.1. The temporary drainage system will be provided and reviewed accordingly to cope with the construction progress. #### a. Area W12 Sewage in the Area W12 will be collected through U-channel constructed in this area into catch pit. Waste water stored in the catch pit shall be pumped into WetSep for treatment. And a 100mm dia. pipe is connected to nearby gully. After settling and reaching filtration requirements, waste water flows out from WetSep into gully through the 100mm link-up pipe. And then through the public drainage routing from M3.12.2 to M3.1, it is discharged into existing box culvert at the proposed discharge point M3.1. #### b. Area W3B/W3A/W3C/W7 Area W3B, W3A, W3C and W7 are all Works Area in the north. Diverted waste water will be collected into “AquaSed”. Dispose wastewater if it is properly treated into gullies in their respective areas through 100mm dia. pipe, and then discharge it along the same route which is from M1.10 to M1.1 finally to public box culvert. #### c. Area W11 and W2 For Area W11, sewage due to the construction works will be conducted by u-channel into sump pit, and pumped into wetsep from sump pit. Then it goes to gully on south road via 100mm dia. pipe, finally flows into respective discharge point. Foundation work for that section of south road will be commenced around 3rd quarter 2025, drainage system will be reviewed and submit separately if required. For Area W2, we proposed to utilize the existing u-channel between AEL/ACL Track and Test Track to collect waste water. At the point where u-channel is approaching the existing final catch pit should be blocked downstream at each subsection, and the collected waste water will be pumped into pre-cast catch pit that is newly placed besides the u-channel. Then waste water is pumped into wetsep from pre-cast catch pit and well treated. After this, it will flow through the 100mm PVC drainage pipe which connects wetsep and existing final catch pit into discharge point. #### d. Area W6A The set-up work for collection and treatment of wastewater is similar to general procedures in area W6A, and M3.1 will serve as discharge point in area W6A to do said disposal of wastewater. #### e. Area W1 Area W1 is in the close vicinity to the public traffic. To enhance the drainage capacity and prevent flood and overflow water during rainy season, stand-by pump would be placed at the lowest point for diverting water rapidly to catch pit. The measure and set-up follow general procedures. SF12.5 will be the discharge point for this area. ### 4. Cement bunding As considering the water-filled barriers and various protective fences would be used for site fencing, the land bunding shall be provided for waste water’s diversion and closure. For the Works area fenced off by water-filled barriers, cement would be used to form a triangular shape paste at the internal bottom of the barriers to close off the water. For existing RP fencing on south road, cement paste which is approximately 100mm in thickness and 150mm high would be casted. For those newly installed fencing in different heights, bunding for preventing water from flowing out should also be casted in the fence-off area. ### 5. Pipe Jacking Pipe jacking will be conducted outside the Depot, so the wastewater shall be collected and treated before discharging into nearby existing public drain following general procedures. ### 6. Maintenance for Temporary Drainage Weekly inspection of the temporary drainage pipes will be implemented during the wet season or before a heavy rain warning signal. The objective is to ensure that there is no obstruction to the drainage path and the system is function properly. Sediment may be accumulated from time to time in the manholes. Therefore, removal of siltation will be carried out inside manholes when accumulation is reported during the inspection. In case of any blockage is found, a high-pressure water jet would be mobilized to flush out the sediment and unblock the drain pipe. In addition, the sedimentation tanks will be cleaned regularly to ensure that are functioning properly at all times. Each inspection should be properly logged with the inspection results available for verification. ### 7. Flood preventive maintenance Weekly inspection of the temporary drainage pipes will be implemented during the Wet Season or before a heavy rain warning signal. The objective is to ensure that there is no obstruction to the drainage path and the system is functioning properly.",
        "8. Safety (Risk Assessments)": "Risk Assessment attached in Appendix A has been prepared for all general activities. Specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow. The Construction Team Leader together with the Safety Team, will supervise the implementation and make adjustment according to the actual site operations, in order to maintain a safe and amicable working environment. ### General Site Safety With reference to the Project Safety Plan, the following items need to be instituted through the course of the works described within this method statement. 1.
