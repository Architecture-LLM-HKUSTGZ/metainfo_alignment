Ensure that the tremie pipe remains submerged in the concrete to prevent the entry of air and ensure a continuous flow of concrete.  6. **Complete the concreting process** by ensuring that the concrete reaches the required cut-off level. The concrete surface should be finished to the required standard and protected from adverse weather conditions.  7. **Cure the concrete** as per the specified requirements to ensure proper strength development. This may include covering the concrete with wet hessian or using curing compounds.
### 7.13 Post-Concreting Activities
1. **Remove any temporary casings** after the concrete has gained sufficient strength. This should be done carefully to avoid damaging the newly placed concrete.  2. **Conduct integrity tests** on the completed pile to ensure it meets the required standards. This may include sonic logging, cross-hole sonic logging, or other approved methods.  3. **Backfill the pile head** with suitable material if required. Ensure the backfill material is compacted to the required standard.  4. **Record and document** all activities related to the bored pile construction, including any tests and inspections. Ensure all records are maintained as per the project requirements.  5. **Clean the site** and remove any debris or equipment used during the bored pile construction. Ensure the site is left in a safe and tidy condition.
## 8. Safety and Environmental Considerations
1. **Ensure all personnel** involved in the bored pile construction are trained and competent.

This includes understanding the method statement and risk assessment.  2. **Safety Training**: All personnel on-site must have valid "Mandatory Basic Safety Training". Workers must attend site safety induction training and register according to the Construction Worker Registration Ordinance.  3. **Equipment Inspection**: Conduct pre-use inspections and maintenance for all plant and equipment before starting work.  4. **Site Safety Measures**: - Fence off or cover any non-constructing boreholes with temporary steel casing tops less than 1m above ground to prevent falls. - Fence off concreted bored piles with concrete surfaces lower than ground level until backfilling with in-situ granular materials is allowed.
### Risk Assessment
1. **Hazard Analysis**: Identify potential hazards, consequences, and mitigations in the risk assessment (Appendix A). 2. **Training**: Ensure the Engineer and Supervisor attend method statement and risk assessment training conducted by the Safety Training Officer.
### Plant & Equipment
1. **Certification**: All plant must have valid test certificates and be equipped with all safety accessories. 2. **Critical Parts Inspection (CPI)**: Conduct CPI by a competent person before starting works. Maintain relevant statutory forms.
### Lifting Appliances and Lifting Gears (LALG)
1. **Inspection**: Inspect all lifting appliances and gears by a competent person and mark them with the safe working load and owner mark. 2. **Certification**: Record statutory certificates properly before starting works. Periodically inspect the condition of all lifting gears and display a color code system to identify their condition.
### Lifting Operation
1. **Supervision**: All lifting operations must be supervised by a designated lifting supervisor, with rigging and signaling carried out by a designated banksman. 2. **Planning**: Properly plan and safely execute all lifting operations in accordance with the Construction Site (Safety) Regulations. Review the lifting plan weekly.
### Site Safety Induction Training Course
1. **Induction Course**: All workers must attend an induction course conducted by the Safety Officer, who will explain necessary safety requirements identified in the risk assessment. 2. **Language**: Use the appropriate language of the workers for all briefings and training courses.
### Fire Prevention
1. **Storage**: Store all flammable materials in a safe location in accordance with the Factories and Industrial Undertaking Regulations. 2. **Hot Work Procedures**: Implement safe hot work procedures, including hot-work permits. Provide fire extinguishers.
### Adverse Weather Condition
1. **Crane Activity**: Stop crane activity immediately and leave the lifting item on the ground if storm or strong wind conditions prevail. 2. **Boom Positioning**: Lay down the boom completely, preferably in the direction of the wind, if wind speeds exceed 20 m/s (45 mph) or gale force 8 are expected.
## 9. Environmental (Environmental Aspect & Impact Identification and Mitigation Measures)
### Mitigation Measures
1. **Noise Control**: - Proper maintenance of equipment. - Scheduling of work. - Use silent type PME. - Wrap breaker tips of excavators with acoustic mats.  2. **Smoke Control**: - Proper maintenance of equipment.  3. **Oil Leak or Spill Control**: - Provide drip trays for stationary machines and stored chemicals. - Proper maintenance of machinery.  4. **Drilling Fluid and Cuttings Control**: - Use bunds, sandbags, or sum pits to intercept. - Recycle drilling fluid using sedimentation tanks.  5. **Dust Control**: - Spray the work area and operation with water before and during the operation.  6. **Drilling Debris Management**: - Tidy up the work area after daily works.
