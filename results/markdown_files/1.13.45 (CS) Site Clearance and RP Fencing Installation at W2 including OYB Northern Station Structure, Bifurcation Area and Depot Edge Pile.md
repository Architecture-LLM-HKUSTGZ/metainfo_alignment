## 8. **Construction Methods / Construction Sequence**
### 8.1 Site clearance, ground levelling and building the temporary platform for fence installation
#### Workfront in W2
Prior to the RP fencing installation, site clearance and ground levelling will be carried to remove vegetation, abandoned cable troughs, remove the cable manhole, track signage and to level up the ground condition.  We will use the hand tools to remove the vegetation. For removing the cable troughs and manhole we will erect shed net to fence off the drilling area, use the electric portable drill to break the concrete and then remove the broken concrete at the same shift. Handheld grinder will be used for existing equipment removal including the existing signage, existing gate relocation, and existing RP Fencing. The hot-work permit will be executed. The fire servers and equipment and fire marshal will be provided.  To meet the programme requirement, it is planned to have 6 work fronts at peak as shown in Figure 8.1-1 below.  - Between GLA1 to GL45; generally flat ground area - Between GL45 to GL58; from test track 5m is flat ground, then slope area. - Between GL58 to GL77; from test track 3m is flat ground, then rock slope area. - Between GL77 to GL100; from test track 6m is flat ground, then slope area. - Between GL100 to GL120; all area is flat area.  As the working area is 10.7m wide, including 2.7m width for the RP footing and sheet/PBSH pile installation, a temporary platform is required to be constructed to provide a level surface to carry out the works.
#### At locations with flat ground
Referring to the existing site condition, from GL 1A to GL 45, granular sub-base will be used to fill and level up the existing ground condition and shall be well compacted. The ground surface will be compacted by the vibratory roller with repeated passes, the actual passes subject to the weight of roller and thickness of subbase. The maximum depth of the filling materials is 150mm.  **Step 1- Install barrier**  Waterfilled barriers will be installed along the test track (2.8m distance from the centre of track) with orange net securely fixed to the existing cable brackets along the mainline side in order to confine the workfront as shown in Figure 8.1-3. After enclosing the works area with water filled barriers and orange net, the workfront area will be declared as a CA Area. Subsequent work can then be carried out during TH, except for passing or lifting over the test track which can only be undertaken during NPH.  **Step 2-Remove Vegetation**  A 3 or 5-ton excavator, to suit availability, will be delivered to the works areas via the access gates and across the test track. To allow the excavator to cross the test track a prefabricated temporary platform will be built to deck over the track when the temporary level crossings are not available. The temporary platform will be removed after the excavator has crossed over the test track. The platform (Figure 8.1-4) will be installed and removed during the same shift and will be designed to allow for lightweight components that can be installed using either the 3 or 5 ton excavator or a mobile crane located on the South Road. Site clearance and ground levelling will be carried out with the assistance of the excavator. In general, granular sub-base will be used for ground levelling. The sub-base, if required, will be delivered to the works area by 5.5 ton dump trucks via the level crossing or steel platform (if the level crossing has not been installed).  The existing RP fence will be temporarily removed locally to allow the excavator to cross the test track and reinstated immediately after the works. The connection details to allow temporary removal of the existing RP fence are shown in Figure 8.1-5, the location for temporary removal of existing fence are shown in Appendix C.  Garbage removal or material delivery will be by manual delivery or rail mounted wagon/engineering train (subject to advance booking and availability) at the initial stage when the BUGN for material lifting over the test track is pending approval. For the manual removal and delivery, access to the works areas will be via the existing emergency gates 4 (EAG4) & 5 (EAG5) during NPH/TH.
#### At locations with sloping ground - Form the working platform for RP Fence and piling works at TH/NPH
From GL 45 to GL 100 the mainline and test track are at different levels and are separated by an existing slope. A working platform shall be formed to provide a level surface for RP fence installation and piling works. The platform will be formed by concrete blocks and filled with compacted granular fill or light weight concrete. The design of the working platform will be submitted separately. The construction sequence is shown below in Figure 8.1.6 with detailed sections at GL20,40,60,80,100 shown in Figure 8.1-7 to 8.1-11.  After completion, the platform shall be checked by the TWC and a Permit to Load issued before use.  **Step 1:** lifting the concrete block to the work area **Step 2:** use the steel tie interlock the concrete block **Step 3:** Lifting the subbase by skip to the work area **Step 4:** Lay and compact the subbase **Step 5:** Repeat lift the concrete block **Step 6:** Lay and compact the final level  The working platform will be constructed from gates TT06 and TT07 from GL 45 to GL 100. The level crossings will be used for material delivery (such as concrete block, backfilled material etc) in order to minimise the lifting method (or waiting for BUGN approval) over test track.
### 8.2 Install the earthing system at ground level during TH
After forming the temporary platform and compacting the sub-base, the electrode rod and earthing pit will be installed below the ground level at a maximum spacing of 20m along the proposed RP Fence, as shown in Figure 8.2-1. The post hole borer will be used to make a ~3m depth of hole for the earthing installation as shown in Figure 8.2-2. The layout plan is shown in the RP Fence layout in Appendix C.
### 8.3 RP fencing installation
#### Stage 1 of RP Fence
Fencing installation will start from GL 20 to GL 120 from June 2024 to Sept 2024 (when the west test track is still in use) and existing gates 4 (EAG4) & 5 (EAG5) will be maintained. Workers will access the works areas via the test track during NPH subject to depot approval. From GL 1A to GL 20, the clearance between the OHL masts of the test track and mainline is constrained such that the potential risk of OHL wire damage or contact during lifting is considered too high. It is proposed to install the RP fence at this location adjacent to the mainline after the west test track closure August 2024. The Stage 1 Layout Plan shown in Figure 8.3-1 refers.
## 9. **Safety**
Safety is paramount in all construction activities, especially when working in close proximity to operational railway lines. The following safety measures will be implemented:  1. **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** All workers will be required to wear appropriate PPE, including helmets, high-visibility vests, safety boots, gloves, and eye protection. 2. **Safety Training:** All workers will undergo safety training specific to railway construction, including the risks associated with working near live tracks and overhead lines. 3. **Site Induction:** A thorough site induction will be conducted for all personnel, covering site-specific hazards, emergency procedures, and safety protocols. 4. **Permit to Work (PTW):** A PTW system will be in place for all high-risk activities, including working near live tracks and lifting operations. 5. **Weather Monitoring:** Weather conditions will be monitored continuously. Work will be suspended if wind speeds exceed 40 km/h or if thunderstorms are forecasted. 6. **Emergency Procedures:** Clear emergency procedures will be established, including the location of first aid stations, emergency contact numbers, and evacuation routes. 7. **Supervision:** A full-time CP(T) will be on-site to oversee safety compliance, and a WPIC will supervise construction activities at each work front. 8. **Isolation of Overhead Lines (OHL):** For any lifting operations over the test track, the OHL must be de-energized, earthed, and isolated. An AP and PTW(E) will supervise the OHL isolation works.
## 10. **Environmental**
Environmental protection measures will be implemented to minimize the impact of construction activities on the surrounding environment:  1. **Dust Control:** Water spraying will be used to suppress dust during site clearance and ground levelling activities. 2. **Noise Control:** Noise barriers will be installed where necessary, and noisy activities will be scheduled during less sensitive times. 3. **Waste Management:** Waste will be segregated and disposed of in accordance with local regulations. Recyclable materials will be separated and sent to recycling facilities. 4. **Spill Prevention:** Spill kits will be available on-site, and all personnel will be trained in spill response procedures. 5. **Vegetation Protection:** Efforts will be made to protect existing vegetation where possible. Any removed vegetation will be replaced as part of the site restoration plan.
## 11. **Quality Control**
Quality control measures will be implemented to ensure that all construction activities meet the required standards and specifications:  1. **Inspection and Testing:** Regular inspections and testing will be conducted to verify that materials and workmanship meet the specified requirements. 2. **Documentation:** Detailed records of all inspections, tests, and quality control activities will be maintained. 3. **Non-Conformance Management:** Any non-conformances will be documented, and corrective actions will be implemented promptly. 4. **Training:** All personnel will be trained in quality control procedures and the importance of maintaining high standards of workmanship. 5. **Third-Party Audits:** Independent third-party audits will be conducted periodically to verify compliance with quality control procedures.
