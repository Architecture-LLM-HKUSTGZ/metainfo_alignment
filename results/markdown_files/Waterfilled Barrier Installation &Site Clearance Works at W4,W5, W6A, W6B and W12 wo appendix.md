### General Arrangement
- All works must be got depot YM approval before commencement. - Access No. 1, all workers entry from carpark must be contact SOC to get approval. - Access No. 2, all vehicles in/out shall be arranged banksman to avoid the traffic jam. - Identify the all existing MTR facilities/materials at or within construction site, such as manhole, OHL portal. - Carry out the condition survey and photographic taking to locate the site conditions, utilities before works start. - Permit-to-dig system will be implemented to avoid the damage to UU during construction period (the method statement will be submitted separately). - If any existing equipment/materials was found during condition surveying, we will fence off and provide protection to stuff. After then, we will report that to depot and liaise with MTR and relative parties. - All workers should possess the qualification Railway Safety training (RSI), and can only smoke at the smoking area that demarcated by CSHK. - Prior to commence the works, CSHK will provide the information to MTR’s CWBU Inspector, in order to submit the work notice to SOC/DCC every Friday. - Condition of waterfilled barrier shall be checked weekly, any damage shall be replaced if necessary and record shall be submitted to MTR. - Approved method statement/EDOC with Chinese version shall be displayed on site for workers. - The fuel of generator must not allow store at the depot area for safety reasons. Also, the generator will be switched off after work daily. - CSHK will provide the shade facilities for workers to rest. - CSHK will provide enough Container Toilets for workers and staffs, and regularly arrange septic tank trucks for disposal.
### Waterfilled Installation near Depot Track (W12)

### Lunch Arrangement for CSHK workers
If number of workers less than 10 people, worker can have their lunch at depot canteen after 12:30pm, if number of workers more than 10 people, worker will go out the site for lunch.
### Works Sequence for Waterfilled Barriers Installation
#### Step 1
Put the labelled cone on manhole cover on site in order to avoid the waterfilled barrier placed on the utilities/manhole cover.
#### Step 2
We will provide the working schedule for depot YM to coordinate for our loading and unloading works. We will use the traffic cone for temporary lane enclosure for loading and unloading. Deliver the waterfilled barrier by manual handing of workers. If it is delivery by lorry, at least two workers will move one barrier by manual handling. - Waterfilled barriers deliver by lorry at W3A, move the barrier from lorry to ground by manual handling. - Workers will transport the waterfilled barriers over the existing road to W12 during the CP(T) supervision.
#### Step 3
Place the waterfilled barriers to proposed alignment, then check the conditions of waterfilled barrier, and then tighten the outlet cover.
#### Step 4
The waterfilled barriers shall be placed in alternate red and white colours and connect together such that they stand out the construction site behind them and are visible by day and night.
#### Step 5
Fill water to waterfilled barriers, and up to the maximum water level according to the operating instructions of the manufacturer. - Due to the application for water supply needs to go through some process and takes time. We planned to use water tank truck for water filling of waterfilled berries. At the same time, we will further discuss the “Temporary water source at South Road” with depot. - The water tank truck shall be filled outside the depot.
#### Step 6
Check whether the water level is between the lowest water level and the highest water level daily. If there is no water after a day, it means that the cover is loose or the barrier is broken, so we should tighten the cover or replace it with a new water-filled barrier.
#### Step 7
Install the top plastic panel on the waterfilled barrier. - The plastic panels should have 1-2 transparent, and we will install the panels 1 in 5 to be transparent. Also, plastic panel will be removed when in typhoon signal no.3 or above.
### Access Gate Arrangement
Red Colour Panels with Notice “出口警告” will be installed at the access gate for easily identified.
### Site Clearance
Remove debris, loose materials, rubbish and weeds/shrubs by hand tools for further UU Detection/ construction works when the waterfilled barriers once completed. Also, the depth not more than 100mm.
### Smoke Arrangement
- All workers should possess the qualification RSI, and must not smoke outside the demarcated area.
## 8. **Safety (Risk Assessments)**
Risk Assessment attached in Appendix A has been prepared for all general activities. Specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow.
