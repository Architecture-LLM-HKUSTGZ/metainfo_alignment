A pre-meeting will be arranged before commencement of the work among Foreman/Engineer/Construction Manager, subcontractor, MTR's representatives and Safety Department to brief the nature of works, the safety aspects and the requirements. Safety helmets fitted with chin straps must be worn within the site, safety boots, hearing protectors (if needed), high visibility jackets/sashes, reflective vest, goggles, gloves and full body harnesses for work at height will be provided to all staff working on site. Warning signs and barriers will be erected where necessary. Particular care needs to be taken when working on or near busy roads. No works will be undertaken unless safe access, including approved and fully implemented TTM/TTAS where necessary. The voltage of any handheld power tools should not exceed 110V and preferably be less than 24V. Any emergency situation shall be reported to Subcontractor and Contractor (i.e. Construction Manager/Engineer/Foreman and Safety Department, etc.) for prompt response. The emergency contact list is shown in Appendix G.
### 8.2 Risk Assessment
Risk Assessment attached in Appendix F has been prepared for all general activities. Specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow. The Construction Team Leader together with the RSO, will supervise the implementation and make adjustments according to the actual site operations, in order to maintain a safe and amicable working environment.
## 9. **Environmental**
The works shall follow relevant mitigation measures as required under the Environmental Permit (EP)/ EP submission and Contractor's Environmental Management Plan (EMP). Works should be carried out during 07:00 to 19:00 on normal working days. No PME will be used after 19:00 on normal working days and Sundays and public holidays unless with a valid construction noise permit. ULSD diesel will be used in all PME. Plant with QPME label will be employed, if available. All chemicals will be placed on drip tray. Waste water will be treated prior to discharge. Noise emission label will be affixed to the handheld breaker. Only regulated NRMM with approved NRMM label to be used on site.
## 10. **Quality Control**
Refer to Appendix F for Inspection and Test Plan. To ensure the attainment of the required standard of works, the methods of working and the required works standards/acceptance criteria are defined in the method statement, inspection & test plans, and are communicated to relevant staff and workers carrying out the works. Day to day routine inspections of the works will be carried out by the Construction Team Leader, Site Engineers and Foreman as appropriate, to ensure that all works are performed following the requirements of these documents. Specific quality checks shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Inspection & Test Plan with "Quality Hold Points" at critical elements for confirmation of compliance before proceeding further. Request for Inspection and Survey Check (RISC) shall be issued to the RSS following inspection of the works by the CSHK's project team.
