<td colspan="5" rowspan="1"> The objective of this work is to improve the traffic condition, provision of additional space in fastlane to afford the future traffic growth of the road section. Moreover, road safety will be strengthened via the fast lane widening task. It is realized that road divider is currently consist of profile barrier and waterfilled barrier to separate fast lane and slow lane independently. The slow lane is temporarily closed under TTA scheme while fast lane is opened for all road users. We would like to mobilize road divider according to out work plan under manual operation and plant operation. The fast lane will become 4.6m width eventually if work is proceeded successfully. </td>

The road width of Shun Long Road in fast lane became narrow (&lt;4.6m min. required) gradually which is measured from continuous edge white line (road markings) along with profile barrier and metal parapet.

It is observed that consecutive profile barriers are installed at part of water filled barrier section as secondary protection wall when traffic accident or collision is happened. Therefore, we would like to guarantee that road width in fast lane after road widening work is accomplished shall be 4.6m in minimum.
