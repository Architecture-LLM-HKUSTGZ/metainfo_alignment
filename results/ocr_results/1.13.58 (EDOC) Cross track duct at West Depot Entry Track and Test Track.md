## 4. Description Of Works

4.1 Title **Contract 1701 –** Cross track duct at West Depot Entry track and test track 4.2 Reason For the future Oyster Bay Station (South) and associated works construction, foundation and superstructure works are to be carried out. To facilitate the construction works for the foundation works in W2 (area between Test Track and mainline) and in W11 (area between North and South Roads), temporary water supply, power supply and temporary drainage system shall be set up and provided for construction works. The temporary services shall be passed through existing tracks including West Depot Entry Track (WDET) and Test Track (TT) to the construction areas. Cross track ducts (as pipe sleeve) shall be installed underneath the existing track for the installation of temporary services 4.3 Description A. **General**
1701 Contractor will carry out the installation of cross track ducting at West Depot Entry Track and Test Track respectively as per correlated latest approved method statement for temporary water supply with cross track duct under **ACC Ref No. 1701-W-000-CSC-760-000132.**
Precaution measures for various potential risks/situation have been reviewed and summarized in the hazard log referring to Appendix B.

## B. Working Time

Mainline: 3 nos of NTH per week (2:00am to 4:00am); 
Test Track: 3 night time (Friday^Saturday, Saturday^Sunday and one on weekday) per week or NPH subject to Depot Schedule; Depot track: NTH (2:00am to 4:00am)/ NPH (11:00am to 3:00pm) daily;

## C. Preparation Work

There are one group of 2 nos. cross track ducts proposed to be installed at the WDET (see Figure 1) and there are 3 groups of 6 nos. of cross track ducts proposed to be installed near the proposed level crossing at TT 
( Nearby gate TT06, TT07 & TT0A ) (see Figures 2 & 3).

Figure 1-West Depot **Entry Track**

![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)

![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)

Before commencement of the installation, the following works shall be completed.

## C.1 Setting Out

The location of cross track duct will be set out as per Construction Drawings or as agreed with MTR's representatives on site.

Once the location has been set out a joint inspection will be held with MTR's representatives on site and other stakeholders or the land owner's/ occupier's representatives to agree the location prior to further execution. At locations where the proposed cross track duct is unlikely to or dangerous to access for either installation or later monitoring works, relocation shall be considered. In principle, one PVC pipe sleeve to be installed between sleepers. As shown the following Figure-4.

![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)

## Figure-4 Arrangement Of Cross Track Duct At Test Track

Referring to the railway safety requirements and construction drawings, if the proposed cross track duct is close to the OHL mast/track, CSHK will further verify the site conditions with MTR/ Depot Yard Master (DYM) representatives onsite to ensure that the proposed location meets the minimum safety distance and take relative precautions, such as deenergize, isolation, relocation…etc.

## C.2 Cable Detection

Utility detection and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey will be carried out after the area is fenced off and after the obstacle above ground are cleared. The details of carrying out utility detection shall follow the approved Method Statement for General Underground Utility Survey for Construction Area (ACC Reference Number 1701/W/000/CSC/760/000095). 

## C.3 Trial Pit

Trial Pits will be carried out in accordance with Permit-to-Dig System before start of the works. For details, please refer to separate submissions
(ACC Reference No.: **170-W-000-CSC-760-000115**).

## C.4 Utility Diversion/ Abandoned Works

Any utilities required diversion or to be abandoned will be carried out with relevant approved EDOC prior to start the works.

## C.5 Pre-Construction Survey

Pre-construction survey, Survey and UU detection will be carried out and completed before the commencement of the works, survey of existing MTR equipment at ground level. Reports to be submitted to MTR, 
showing the protections applying to the MTR equipment.

## C.6 Instrumentation And Monitoring

Setting up instrumentation monitoring plan and taking initial readings as per the BD approved drawings. The method statement for setting up instrumentation monitoring is described in 'Method Statement for Instrumentation and Monitoring Works at Operations Area (OA)' (ACC 
Reference Number **1701/W/000/CSC/760/000122**), EDOC for Instrumentation and Monitoring Works (ACC Reference Number 1701-
W-000-CSC-143-000284) and (EDOC Reference Number **ZCV20240)** and 'Method Statement for Instrumentation and Monitoring Works at Construction Area (CA)' (ACC Reference Number 1701/W/000/CSC/760/000138). For those standpipe and piezometer, it will be installed at the location which are 10 meters far away from the existing live tracks.

AAA Levels will be used for the monitoring works in drawings no.

## D. Installation Procedure

The following are the installation sequence and method for different type of cross track ducts installation:
i. Excavate/ remove ballast manually.

![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)

ii. Install 150mm diameter PVC pipe sleeve and it shall be installed at least 50mm below the rail.

iii. Backfill ballast and carry out compaction.

iv. For water pipe, one gate valve will be installed at the both side of the track to stop supply in case of pipe burst.

![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)

## Plan

v. Weekly inspection will be conducted to ensure the condition of the installation.

The following are the typical layout plan for the cross track ducts 

![6_image_1.png](6_image_1.png)

## E. Maintenance Regime

i. All construction material shall be stored in designated area agreed with MTR. Stacking of material over 2m shall be avoided.

ii. Removal of unnecessary construction materials / rubbish daily.

iii. Coordinate with T&ES to conduct structure gauge check (after the proposed location setting out).

iv. WPIC to ensure all installation follow the approved drawings 
(including the fixing details) and do not infringe structural gauge. 

Independent check shall be conducted by the WPIC. 

v. Post-construction inspection by WPIC and WPIC/MTR CM Team to examine workmanship and ensure all new parts are securely fixed / 
properly installed. 

vi. Regular check and maintenance including water meter and gate valve of water main at the cross track duct shall be carried out.

vii. Use tool record sheet to record all the tools used for construction during each Possession Hour period PA works. 

viii. CP(T) to check the tool record sheet (with photo record) and ensure that all tools used in construction at track area are cleared away from the track area and do not leave at the track.
