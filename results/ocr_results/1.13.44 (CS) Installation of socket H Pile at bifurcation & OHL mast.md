### 7.2.2 General logistics arrangement: Material and Plant delivery 

Height checking vehicle before entering East/West gate

Before entering the west gate/east gate, CP(T) will measure the height of vehicle to ensur ethe height is within 4m. After entering the east/west gate, the Contractor Vehicle will be accompanied by the escort vehicle with CP(T). 

A Permit-to-Move is required for vehicles over 4m high and below 4.5m high. Vehicle height measurements/ checks for approval by CWBU to DCC shall be conducted by CP(T)s before entering the depot areas and passing through the west level crossing. When accessing the west level crossing, an escort car with a CP(T) shall communicate with DCC in order to get permission to drive across the level crossing. CP(T) shall inform DYM when the vehicles are passing through the yellow line underneath the height restriction gauge and within the double white zone. No vehicle Reversing is allowed. 

#### 7.2.2.1 Logistics Arrangement from GL A1  –GL 40

We will primarily use the East Gate for the Works at GL A1-40. At this area the test track is to be removed from GL A1  -GL40. The ground level is relatively flat and does not require backfilling. After removal of the test track and OHL mast, construction vehicles with height limited to 4m will be able to access in and out of this area without a level crossing and lifting over the test track is not required for delivering plant and materials.

#### 7.2.2.2 Logistics Arrangement from GL 40  –GL 100

We will primarily use the East Gate and level crossing at **Gate 0**  **6** and **Gate**  **A** for the Works at GL 40-100. At this area the test track is to be maintained. Backfill along the existing slope is required for the erection of RP fencing. Details of the backfilling and erection of the RP fencing shall refer to the separate method statement of RP fencing. After backfilling, the rigs would be able to access from the lower side of **Gate 06 and Gate**  **A** as shown below.

The piling rigs need to cross the level crossing to access the working location. The travelling height of a rig is around 3.80m, which is lower than the max height allowed at the level crossing, and its width is 2.26m. During working condition, the rig will be positioned parallel with the test track, reducing the risk and hazard of damaging the cables. The working height of the rigs will be 9m in total reduced from 13.61m to suit the overall height of the Railway Protection fencing.

<!-- Model Plant: HD205P Plan & Section of the Elevation of Drilling Rig for Socket H  -->

Due to the restricted work area, lifting over the test track is required for delivery of construction equipment and materials. This will be subject to a separate approved EDOC and BUGN being issued by MTR prior to commencing any lifting works. 

<!-- 9.3T×0.8=7.44T>2.7T0kl  -->

Lifting Plan layout at W2

<!-- 75TCrane Lorry  -->

A temporary steel cover will be installed between GL 40 and GL100, (Detail refer to separate MS and EDOC) details of which will be provided under a separate Method Statement and detailed design submission. After installation of the steel cover, construction material can be lifted across the text track during day time and not limited to NTH only. This would greatly facilitate material delivery and the frequency of using NTH can be greatly reduced. 

The casings will be properly stored on site at W2 and secured by using a U-shaped steel clamp fixed to each end of the casings on the bottom row as shown below. Steel wedges would be placed under the bottom of the outer bottom row casings to prevent movement or toppling. The H beams will be stacked in a horizontal position to prevent toppling as shown below (max. height 1.7m/ 9 number that can be stacked). No more than 2 batches of casing/H-pile shall be stored in the bifurcation per work

### 7.2.3 Logistics Arrangement: Grouting

<!-- Pumping Station layout at W2  -->

We propose to use on site mixing for the pile grouting due to the restricted space available at W2, the grouting station will be located at W11. There will be several grouting stations located at W1 1with multiple storing tanks. Cement at the storing tanks/silo will be replenished by using a cement tanker truck through the hose from the refill truck. The grout station will be properly covered. There will be a separate grout pump connected to the grouting station to deliver the mixed grout. The grout pipe wil lbe connected from the grout pump through the buried pipe under the test track and to the designated pile at W2 (Detail refer to separate MS and EDOC). The station will be delivered by flat lorry via the vehicular steel bridge and unloaded at W11. The detail of the pumping station shall refer to Appendix E.

Typical Grouting Station located at W11

## 7.3 Construction Method/Sequence for W1

### 7.3.1 Logistics Arrangement: Labour & Plant Access through TTA Gate 3

On the South Side, there is an existing access gate (TTA Gate 3) from the slip road from the Tai Ho Interchange. An additional access gate (TTA Gate 3A) is proposed to be installed at the eastern end of Shun Long Slip Road for access and egress to the OHL portal and OYB -South construction areas.

Surveyors will set out the levels, position and alignment of all piles. Permits-to -Excavate will be issued and briefed to the associated site personnel by the CP and WPIC prior to any drilling works. The setting out will be checked by joint survey with MTR’s survey team.

### 7.4.2 Drilling with Casing (Permanent)

For each pile, position the drill rig at the setting out location. Lift the **6**  **m** steel casing by mobile crane to the drill rig and fix the steel casing with the drill rig's hydraulic retaining clamp. Once secured, lift the drill bit and insert it into the steel casing. Fix the drill bit with the drill rig's rotator and fix the ring

bit to the drill bit and release the hydraulic retaining clamp. Check the verticality with the use of a spirit level in two perpendicular directions and adjust until vertical. Onc ecomplete and checked drilling may commence.

Each pile is drilled concurrently with the casing installation by using the ring bit method until the blockhead is reached. The verticality of the pile will be checked again once the first section of steel casing has been installed. Refer to Table 19.1 of the M&W Specification for the verticality tolerance. In accordance with the Project Specification, piles within 10m cannot be installed concurrently. 

The RP fence structure is required to have sufficient clearance to the structural gauge which is a minimum of 2615 mm measured, from rail centreline, for the depot track and it is 2995 mm for the mainline. Refer to the RP fence method statement, submitted separately, for details.

Minimum Working Space for Socket H Pile along Track:

=1.35m (width of RP fence footing) + 0.5m (clearance) +1.7m (half width of piling rig)

If a pile is found to be out of tolerance, the casing will be extracted and re-drilled to the required position. If a pile is found within tolerance, th edrilling will continue until reaching the required level. After reaching the required level, retract the drill rods and cover the top of the casing to prevent any object / body falling into the hole.

The drill bit shall not advance independently of the casing. During installation of the permanent casing, the drilling bit must be interlocked with the casing by the pilot bit and casing shoe as shown in the attached catalogue in Appendix D. Each segment of the steel casing are joined by butt-welding to form a continuous casing. During welding, a spirit level will be used to ensure the straightness of the joint between the 2 steel sections.

Upon the completion of permanent the casing installation, the volume of excavated material will be compared to the theoretical quantity to determine the extent of over break (if any). a procedure shall

Theminimum length of rock socket shall be in accordance with the Contract drawings. The Engineer'sRepresentative shall be informed to witness once the rockhead level has been reached.Rocksamples shall be collected for inspection by the Engineers representative.7.4.4 Installation of Steel H PileAfter cleaning of the pile and prio to installation of the steel section, the MTR inspection team will beinvited to check and verify the depth.12m Steel H-pile sections (305x305x223 kg/m UBP) prefabricated will be lifted by mobile crane intothe installed steel casing. The final length of the H-pile sections to be installed will be agreed with RPdepending on the proximity of the pile to the nearest running rail. Temporary positioning plates shallbe welding to the side of the H-pile prior to installation to support the pile once installed and allowwelding of the subsequent H-pile section. The positioning plates shall be subject to a design and ICEcheck prior installation. After welding of the H-pile sections, splice plates and strengthening plates asshown on the contract drawings, shall be welded into position at each joint of the H-pile. This processwill continue until the H-pile has been installed to the full depth of the pile. During welding,a spiritlevel will be used to ensure the straightness of the joint between the 2 steel sections. The weldingprocedure and welder certificates shall be submitted separately for approval to ensure all site weldsmeet the contract specification. All welds shall be subject to visual inspection and NDT testing inaccordance with the M&W Specification. No welding on site is subjected to a hot works permit beingissued in advance by CSHK.</td>

### 7.4.5 Grouting

Cement grout mixed from the grout station will be pumped into the bottom level of each pile by tremie method through two 20mm grout pipes using the hydraulic pump until the required level has been reached. A grout of w/c ratio 0.4 is specified with a minimum strength of 30MPa at 28 days.

The length of the grout tube shall match with the depth of the hole to ensure the tube reaches the bottom of the hole prior to grouting. The grout tube is at all times submerged into the grout (i.e. at least 2m below the grout top level) within the drillhole, displacing any water as it rises. The grouting operation will cease once the confirmed grout top level has been verified by dipping method and a visual inspection completed. 

Monitoring of the grout top level by dipping method will continue immediately after grouting has been completed to check for any grout loss due to soil movement or casing displacement, however as the casings are left in permanently this is considered unlikely. In the event that grout loss occurs, the grouting operation will resum eto fill the void or replace the displaced material with cement grout. Withdraw the steel grou tpipes.

Cement grout will be tested as follows:

For the testing of pile loading, due to narrow site space (width from 7.5m to 10m approximately after 7m fence installation), the traditional kentledge setup which requires large area to install concrete block which is not feasible in this situation (Refer to the figure below). Therefore, we propose to use reaction pile method for testing. The location of pile will be selected by MTR or BD .Reaction pile will be installed and then conducted pile testing. Refer to figure below for the testing set up.
