## 7. Construction Methods/Construction Sequence

## 7.1 Preparation

-Identify the existing MTR facilities at or within constructionsite,such as manhole cover,cable

draw pits. If we find any MTR existing equipment/material, we will fence off the existing MTR

facilities as the protective measures.

- Conduct the underground utilities survey and photographic record to locate any UUs before

any excavation works. Permit to dig system will be implemented to ensure there is no damage

to the existing UUs before commencement of works.

-Site clearance for above ground will be carried out with the use of grab lorry, as per the approved

method statement, Installation of Water Filled Barrier at W3 and W7 Erection of Container and Site

Office at W7 Site Clearance at W3 (ACC Reference Number: 1701/W/000/CSC/000053).

- For all types of lifting appliance being used for lifting operation onsite, the Permit to Lift will be

applied in according with the Lifting Matrix. A lifting supervisor is to be assigned to direct

supervise the operation and complete the Permit to Lift.

- Prior to commence the works, CSHK will provide the information to MTR CWBU Inspector,in

order to submit the work notice to SOC/DCC every Friday.

## 7.4C Construction of The Manhole and Pipe Installation for Access Road B by Open Cut Method and ELS

Open cut method and ELS are intended to be used for construction of the manhole and pipe installation for Access Road B, and subject to approval by ICE. The design details are referred to Appendix D. The following is the sequence of open cut and ELS for construction.

## i. To install ground monitoring points and take initial readings prior to commencement of the works.

## ii.Drive sheet pile wall with interlocking down to the design toe level.

iii.Groundwater is drawdown by sump pump.

## iv. Trim the 1:2 soil slope at the eastern and western side of the trench and carry out trench excavation to the final excavation level.

As the sheet pile wall is installed in adjacent carriageway, temporary traffic arrangement will be implemented on West Wash Plant Road and Main Depot Road. It is referred to Drawing No.1701/OYB//001-1 and 1701/OYB//001-2,and 1701/OYB//002-1 and 1701/OYB//002-2 in Appendix E respectively.
