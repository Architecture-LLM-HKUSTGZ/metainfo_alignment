**Dear Wa & Kenny (CSHK teammate)** 

**Please find the following site TCPs comments on P1B Predrilling method statement for your follow up.Thank you. ** 

**Major comments:** 

**1.**  **For SecƟon 3, the proposed “Drilltech Geotechncial Engineering Ltd” is not in RSC(GIFW) Register of Specialist Contractors (Sub-register of Ground InvesƟgaƟon Field Works Category). Please clarify if the**  **company is referring to “DRILTECH GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING LIMITED” in the above register. ** 

**2.**  **For SecƟon 4, it seems none of the deployed staff in the secƟon 4 table are the TCPs covered in the site supervision plan (SSP) submiƩed to BD in effect. Please be reminded to follow the required inspecƟon frequency for proposed TCP-T4/T2/T1 as per the SSP & BD approval leƩer condiƟons, and the required inspecƟon frequency for criƟcal stage of works as per the CoP for site supervision (e.g. twice a week inspecƟon frequency for RC T4 for pre-drilling works of large diameter bored piles and socketed H-piles)** 

**3.**  **Please be reminded that the sampling and tesƟng requirements shall follow the latest BD approved drawings, including but not limited to standard penetraƟon test.** 

**4.**  **Please provide the details of the followings in SecƟon 7 – construcƟon methods / construcƟon sequence:** 

 **InstrumentaƟon and monitoring shall be installed and monitored prior to pre-drilling works commence. ** 

 **in case the pre-drill hole encounters UU or other underground obstrucƟon which require pre-drill**  **hole relocaƟon, the contractor shall submit the alternaƟve pre-drill hole locaƟon for MTR-CM & DM/DDC/TCP review and agreement. ** 

 **VerƟcality control for the drilling operaƟon;** 

 **Please specify the length of core runs for the rock sample.** 

 **Please specify the terminaƟon criteria for the predrilling works of large diameter bored pile and**  **socketed H-piles. ** 

 **Please specify the grout strength for backiflling.** 

 **Please include the criteria for standard penetraƟon test in the BD approved drawings** 

 **During the course of the Works, a daily record sheet shall be submiƩed to the RSE/RGE’s site representaƟve, in the agreed format, containing the informaƟon required by the SpecificaƟon within 1 working day or agreed period aŌer the ifeld operaƟons to which they refer have been carried out. The format of daily record sheet and preliminary log sheet shall be submiƩed to the**  **RSE/ RGE’s site representaƟve for approval before work commences.**

General Access to works at W11 & W12 

During Mar 2024, when the vehicular access bridge is not ready for delivery, we would temporarily utilize west gate via the west level crossing to deliver the plant and material. During delivery from West gate, escort vehicle with CPs would be deployed to escort the construction vehicles. CP(T) would be stationed at the West Gate to check the vehicular height and direct the traffic and communicate with the yard master continuously. Apart

from the construction vehicles, shuttle escorted by escort vehicle would be arranged to directly carry the worker from West Gate to the Container Village at W11 via the West level crossing. 

We would utilize the East gate once the vehicular access bridge is ready to use after May 2024. Similar safety procedure same as West Gate would be deployed. Nonetheless, we would hold regular workshops with RP/Yard master to go through current works within all CAs in order to identify and review any impact upon railway and/or depot operation. The rules and procedures for Railway Protection under the Railway Ordinance will be in accordance with Practice Note for Authorized Persons, Registered Structural Engineers and Registered Geotechnical Engineers (PNAP ADV-33 / APP-24) and MTRCL working paper No.6-Railway Protection-Revision B-December 2022.

The detail of general logistics should refer to the submitted security and traffic management plan.

During first few months of the project, temporary water would be sourced from the drainage pipe along the south road to W11. A 200mm recessed would be formed to bury the drainage pipe to across the South Road which is subjected to depot’s approval and we would follow depot’s procedure for obtaining the water.

(1) Project’s team colleague to read the Contractor’s usage monthly and obtain the Contractor’s agreement on the monthly usage. 

(2) Project’s team to pass the agreed usage to Control & Support Officer - Opt&Metro - OpsPerf&Supp-Ctl&Sup) for calculation of the water costs with management cost 

(3) CMD’s colleague to provide the calculation of the water costs to the Contractor to obtain their agreement before formal issuance of debit note/ invoice.

(5) The Contractor to pay MTRCL directly. 

(6) Water usage record (i.e. Meter readings) to be emailed to SHD Dev. for reference each month.

After connection to WSD water point at Tai Ho interchange, drainage pipe would be connected fromTai Ho Interchange and to W11 via the West level Crossing.

7.3.1 Utility detection

At each drill hole location, cable detection will be carried out by competent person. The details of utility detection shall refer to separate method statement submission. 

7.3.2 Setting Out

Location of drill hole will be set out using conventional surveying techniques and, marked out on site before proceeding and to be checked by MTR before work commencement. The setting out of each drill holes with ground level shall be taken after set up. The level of top of drill hole shall be taken after drilling.

7.3.3 Trial pits of each predrill hole

After utility detection, a trial pit for each predrill holes with area about 200mm×200mm and 2.5m from existing ground level will be hand excavated by hand auger with PVC pipe sleeve to ensure the proposal drill hole location is free from any clearance of obstruction and underground utility. Permit to dig system for excavation of inspection pit shall be implemented. If and doubt exists regarding the drilling safety or public safety, an alternative drill hole position will be arranged for prior agreement with the Project Manager.

The position of pre-drill would be the same as the location of trial pit. In view of obstruction of potential underground utilities and boulders, the location of trial pit / pre-drill would be deemed acceptable with respect of the following circumstance: 

1. For trial pit / pre-drilling of bore piles, the trial pit / pre-drill location should be within the bore pile casing.

2. For trial pit / pre-drilling of socket H piles, the trial pit / pre-drill location should be carried out such that the toe of every pile is within 5m distance from a trial pit / pre-drilling hole. 

In case the pre-drill hole encounters UU or other underground obstruction and could not fulfill the condition stated above and therefore require pre-drill hole relocation, the contractor shall submit the alternative pre-drill hole location for MTR-CM & DM/DDC/TCP review and agreement.

7.3.4 Instrumentation and Monitoring 

Instrumentation and monitoring shall be installed and monitored prior to pre-drilling works commence with method refer to separate method statement via submission no. 1701-W-000-CSC-760-000138.

7.4 Method of Drilling and sequence

Logistics and Delivery of drilling rig

For lifting/mobilization of drilling rigs, carne lorry will be used at the works area. The lifting capacity is reduced to 80% of the crane lorry. Apart from drilling rig, empty water tank and casing with hanger would be delivered to works area also by crane lorry. The LALG certificates would be provided checked prior lifting.
