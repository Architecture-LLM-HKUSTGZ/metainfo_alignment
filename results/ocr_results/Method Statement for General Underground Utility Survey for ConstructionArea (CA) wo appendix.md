6.2 Methods for Opening Cable Trough, Manhole or Draw Pit Cover

6.2.1 Clean the surrounding loose materials and elements to avoid materials fell into the cable trough/ manholes/ draw pit.

6.2.2 Use appropriate manholes cover lifters for opening the manhole cover. Below pictures are shown several typical safe working procedures for opening heavy duty manhole cover.

6.2.3 The lifting handles are for two-handed lifting

6.2.4 Locking nut on the threaded key section shall be secured with the key in place tightly on the cover.

6.2.5 Worker shall check the key nut fully insert to the cover hole to reduce risk of dropping cover.

6.2.6 Carefully lift up the cover simultaneously with two workers, and then place the cover onto the flat ground.

6.2.7 After completion of UU survey, workers shall reverse the above-mentioned procedure to reinstate.
