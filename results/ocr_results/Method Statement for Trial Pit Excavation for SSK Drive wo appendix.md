⚫ Trial Pit shall be of size 1.5m x 1.5m and terminated at 1.5 m deep at most. If necessary,excavator or other plant and equipment will be deployed to remove the existing concrete and hard material for opening of road paving or any obstruction to pit excavation.

⚫ The proposed extent for trial pit is shown in the layout plans attached in Appendix A.The exact location and number of trial pit will be subjected to actual site conditions.

⚫ For trial pit will be carried out by hand digging. No mechanical plant can be used for digging and can be only used as bucket for assistance.

⚫ Excavated materials from the trial pit shall be temporarily stockpiled at designated areas and covered by secured tarpaulin sheets to prevent rainwater seepage and suppress dust.

⚫ For underground utilities encountered, the type, location, dimension and nature shall be recorded. Exposed UU should be labelled and protected on site.

⚫ When groundwater is encountered before reaching the inspection pit tentative depth, the following procedures be followed: 

a. The location of the inspection pit should be set to identify target utilities in agreement with the MTR’s representative.

b. The excavation of the inspection pit should be stopped if the collapse of the inspection pit.

c. MTR’s agreement on the termination of the excavation will be sought.

⚫ Trial pit shall be backfilled by the excavated granular soil material until the original ground level is restored. 

⚫ To ensure the worker carrying out the inspection pit excavation works are fully informed of the risks and they are aware of the measures to control those risks, the Briefing will be provided before operation commence.

⚫ Trial pit shall be inspected on weekly basis by competent person and Form 4 –Excavation of Earthworks shall be filled in to ensure the inspection pit is in safe conditions.

⚫ Proper ladder access should be landed on firm and level base for workers excavation works /Supervisors inspection in the Trial Pit. The ladder should extend 1m higher than the landing place.
