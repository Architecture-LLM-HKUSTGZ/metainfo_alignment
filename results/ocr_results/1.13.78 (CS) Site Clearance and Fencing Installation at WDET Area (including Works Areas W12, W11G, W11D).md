As the piling works are in close proximity to the existing WDET, there is not enough available space to provide an offset of 850mm from the OHL return feeder wire to the RP fence. It is found from available information (point cloud, structural drawings, site survey) that in order to carry out the piling as shown on the drawings,two constraints need to be released:

1.The RP fence will need to be installed with the minimum possible offset to the OHL feeder wire.The simplest solution will be to sleeve the existing OHL feeder wires, however if it is not possible to do this,then electrical isolation can be added to the RP fence. With isolation the fence could be installed at 150mm horizontal distance to the nearest OHL feeder wire.

## 2. The Piling contractor's RCD rig will need to be modified for the reduced clearance available to the RP fence.

Figures 1.4 and 1.5 show the distance from the nearest piles to the OHL feeder wire at both the north and south sides of the existing WDET. Figure 1.6 shows the possible set up of the fence at 150mm horizontal off-set whilst maintaining 850mm separation.

For Area W12 the existing chain link fence will be removed and new fencing installed to create a new boundary to the Construction Area. To ensure integrity of security to the depot area, the replacement fence-line will be installed before removal of sections of the existing security fence.

Figure 1.7 below shows the extent of the new sections of security chain link fence with gates,which will meet the new RP fencing near the WDET.

Figure 8.1-1 Work-fronts to be Mobilised for WDET Area

The existing ground level varies slightly but in general lies between approx. 5.5m and 6.5mPD.This will be readily flattened by levelling; no high rockhead is known to be present in this area. Following levelling of the existing ground a temporary working platform will be formed for subsequent works;granular sub-base will be used to fill and level up the existing ground condition and will be well compacted by vibratory rollers with repeated passes, with the actual number of passes to achieve the specified level of compaction subject to the weight of roller.

The following steps will be carried out to achieve this.

Step 1-Install Barrier(NPH)

Waterfilled barriers will be installed along both sides of the WDET (2.8m distance from the centre of nearest track) in order to delineate a working area which can then be defined as a CA (Construction Area). All subsequent works, except for RP fence platform preparation and fence installation directly adjacent to the OHL infrastructure, can then be carried out during traffic hours(TH).

Step 2 -Remove Vegetation,Level and Compact Ground behind Water Barriers (TH)

A 3 or 5-ton excavator, to suit availability, will be delivered to the works areas via the access roads.Site clearance and ground levelling will be carried out with the assistance of the excavator.In general,granular sub-base will be used for ground levelling. The sub-base, if required, will be delivered to the works area by 5.5-ton dump trucks. Rubbish removal and material delivery will be by manual delivery.For manual removal and delivery, access to the works areas will be via the existing west wheel wash road and south depot road.

Step 3 -Form the Working Platform for the RP Fence (NPH)

This work will be carried out over the water filled barriers and hence requires NPH. It is essentially the same as Step 2 but with the added railway precautions enabled by NPH working. Currently it is not anticipated to remove the existing cable troughs, but rather to work around them.

## 8.2 Install the Earthing System at Ground Level During TH

After forming the temporary platform and compacting the sub-base, the electrode rod and earthing pit will be installed below the ground level at a maximum spacing of 20m along the proposed RP Fence,as shown in Figure 8.2-1.

## 8.3 RP Fence Installation

Upon completion of the site clearance and working platform, the RP fence installation will commence.The details of the RP fence setting out are shown in Appendix C. The sequence of work is as follows:

Construction works will be carried out in close proximity to the existing test track and WDET which require robust railway protection measures to be in place before commencement of any physical site works. Referring to (Library) Working Paper No.6 & the approved BUGN-Railway Protection (pending), a minimum 7 m high fence is proposed for activities which require the use of plant/machinery with high booms adjacent to the fence, or where the OHL masts are located on that side of the track. The minimum clearance between fence mesh and the OHL fault return wire is required to be at least 850 mm, but may be reduced with electrical isolation introduced, and with the agreement of MTRC.

The closest part of the fence structure is required to have a minimum of 2615 mm clearance to the track centre for tracks inside the depot (Scope Cl. S205.6.11(i)).

As the installation of the RP fence will be undertaken in close proximity to the OHL line (within 2m radius), an AP(E) and PTW(E) are also required to be provided.The RP Fence installation works will be undertaken during NPH after the OHL has been de-energised.

The footing and RP fence frame will be prefabricated off site using a standard size to allow installation of the footing and fence frame directly on site. As the final distance between the OHL & RP fence will be only 150mm, an insulation coating is provided and installed on the RP fence at OHL level.The details of the 7m fence are shown in Figure 8.3-1. The tentative dimensions of the insulation coating can be referred to Figure 1.6. The concrete footings will be interlocked by PFC steel ties as shown in Figure 8.3-2. For the layout plan of the RP Fence please refer Appendix C.

The prefabricated fence will be first delivered to the storage yard in Hong Kong (detailed location TBC) for quality checking before installation. Material will be delivered to site in a "just in time" delivery pattern as there is insufficient space for large quantities of material storage on site.

Figure 8.3-3 shows the planning of the location of the concrete block footings relative to the WDET and avoiding the need to divert existing cable troughs.

Fencing installation trial for workers

As the installation of the RP Fence requires NTH/NPH as well as working in close proximity to the existing railway lines, to ensure no potential incident / accident/ damage / disruption to the railway a 'mock-up' will be set up at the outside storage yard to simulate the site condition of the OHL mast and fault return wire. Foreman, workers and plant operators will be able to carry out a trial installation of the RP fence in a non-railway environment. The aim of this arrangement is to allow the foremen and workers to familiarise themselves with the sequence, methods and risks associated with the installation works off-line from the railway. Through this trial, all workers/staff involved with the

The following conditions will apply:·wind speed less than 40 km/h·Call off works if adverse Weather occurs, or within 2 hours of occurrence· Stop construction work when thunderstorms occurRP Fence Construction TimeRP Fence installation along the WDET will be carried out during NPH, tentatively 11:00hrs to15:00hrs.A pre-work briefing and mobilisation of equipment and materials will be carried out in advance oftrack access. Once track possession has been granted by the TC,the OHL de-energised andflashing lamps installed, fencing installation work will commence. Before the end of each shift,allcompleted fence installation works shall be checked by the MTR inspector and CSHK's TWC toensure the installation is in accordance with the working drawings and stable before leaving the site.In addition,the fence shall be earthed at the end of each shift and checked by a suitably qualifiedREW. The table below shows the detailed working schedule.The sequence of work for the RP fence erection is as follows:Advance Works for RP Fence Installation:1. Form working platform behind the water filled barrier (TH) and level platform for fenceconcrete block installation (NPH) (refer to 8.1 above)2. Install earthing system for future fence (TH) (refer to 8.2 above)3. Survey and set out RP Fence location for upcoming works (NPH)4.

## 5. Development and approval of specific Lifting Plan.The main lifts will be:

Concretefootings (1.125mx 1.35m x 1.5m;5.5t).These footings need to be space proofed in the lifting plan to ensure both sufficient clearance over the top of the existing cable troughs, and sufficient clearance below the OHL feeder wire for the jib, lifting gear (chains) and the 1.5m tall footings themselves (refer to Figure 8.3-5).

· Steel ties (100x50x 10 PFC sections; 10.2kg/m run). These will be lifted onto the top of the concrete blocks and manually slid to their final fixing position

·Prefabricated fence sections (approx. 5.5m high x 2.25m wide; 350kg-refer to Appendix C for drawings). These can be lifted directly into their final position, 1250mm away from the existing OHL feeder wire, using guide ropes to ensure a smooth and controlled lift.

6. Delivery of fence materials at the immediate work-front behind the water filled barriers ready for NPH(TH).

## 7. Delivery and set up of mobile crane behind the water-filled barriers; compliance checks,briefings,permit to lift(TH).

Workmanship/Quality Control during/after Fencing Installation

The following control checking will be carried out:

1.During the erection of the protective fencing,a site check will be carried out after each shift of work to ensure all protection fence erected does not infringe the Structural Gauge (SG) and achievs or maintains the design clearance.

## 2. After completion of installation, a weekly inspection is carried out and the RP fence maintained by CSHK.

## 3. In addition, the fencing will be erected with non-reflective coverings, so as to ensure light glare will not affect train operations. Moreover, there will be no impact to the EMU speed limit within the depot,inbound and outbound train arrangements and the Train Operator accessing EMU

## 4. A Guideline with communication protocol, following RSR, will be developed and included in the Traffic and Security Management Plan for describing how to access the WDET by using any EAGs/CA access gates. All the EAGs / CA access gates shall be locked with designated MTR padlocks.The Traffic and Security Management Plan will be discussed and submitted separately. Warning signs shall be erected, which should follow those installed on the existing WDET. CCTVs will be installed at access gates and available for the Depot Control Centre (DCC) to provide real-time monitoring of EAG / access gate status by YMs. Meanwhile, MTR QR-codes to be applied for the CA access gates at Area W2 (G) for mainline access.

Contingency Arrangement for Plant Breakdown during NPH

Spare mobile cranes will be available elsewhere on site, with 6 workers available for any emergency (such as plant breakdown etc),during fencing installation and lifting work for concrete block installation and during the construction of the working platform for piling works.

Larger excavators, crane lorries or tele-handlers will be available for towing the 3 or 5t excavators clear in the event of breakdown when working near the WDET.

## 8.4 Existing Chain Link Fence Removal and New Chain Link Fence Installation

The new security fence to Works Area W12 will be installed prior to removal of sections of the old,in order to maintain security to the depot at all times. The new security fence will meet the new WDET RP fence to ensure full enclosure of the Construction Area.

The following Figures 8.4-1 to 8.4-4 show details of the fence to Highways Department standards.
