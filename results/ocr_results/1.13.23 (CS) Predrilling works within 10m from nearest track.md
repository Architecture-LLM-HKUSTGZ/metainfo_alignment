The detail of general logistics should refer to the submitted security and traffic management plan.

At W2 bifurcation area, labour would access the working area during NPH (0800-0830,1130-1200, 1300-1330,1730-1800 of each day) from Gate 4 to Gate A. CP(T) and WPIC would escort the workers crossing the test track and supervise the whole drilling operation by the workers. We propose to start the predrilling works prior the erection of RP fencing which is subjected to final approval from the depot. All workers are required to pass the RSI training and EDOC would need to be approved for working in the area. Nonetheless, we would hold regular workshops with RP/Yard master to go through current works within all CAs in order to identify and review any impact upon railway and/or depot operation. The rules and procedures for Railway Protection under the Railway Ordinance will be in accordance with Practice Note for Authorized Persons, Registered Structural Engineers and Registered Geotechnical Engineers (PNAP ADV-33 / APP-24) and MTRCL working paper No.6-Railway Protection-Revision B-December 2022.

## 7.3 Method of Drilling and sequence

According to PNAP APP-18, pre-drilling should be carried out such that the toe of every pile is within 5m radius form a pre-drilling hole. That means no two drill holes shall sunk simultaneously within 10m distance.Generally working phase shall refer to Appendix D

According to these requirements, each pile group is associated with a predrill number as shown below. The full layout can be found at Appendix D which Predrills holes are marked. It also shown the relationship between the predrill holes and MTR OHL.

<!-- TEST TRACK  LINE POST 2.3m Clearance 2.3m Clearance AEL LINE POST  -->

Predrill Plan against existing OHL of AEL and Test Track

Section A

All pre-drilling works shall be carried out by a specialist contractor who is under the "List of Approved Suppliers of Materials and Specialist Contractors in Public Works" in the Ground Investigation Field Work Category or in the Soil and Rock Testing Category. The sequence of work shall be carried out in compliance with the BD Approved drawings. This scope comprises of land vertical drill holes together with in situ tests for the determination of foundation levels and is described in the general notes of the drawings. 

The works shall include:

- Rotary wash boring and rock coring of pre-drill holes for Pile and Instrumentation (Piezometer / Standpipe/ lnclinometer/ Magnetic Probe Extensometer)

- Standard Penetration Test

Drilling, Sampling and in-situ testing will be performed in accordance with the Material Works (M&W) requirement, Section 24: Ground Investigation.

A Geotechnical Field Technician (GFT) would be provided full-time on-site supervision on ground investigation field works. GFTs shall be provided for all working drilling rig deployed. Separate competent persons (CP(Logging)) would carry out the logging and preparation of borehole logs. CP(Supervision) would supervise on site different stages of ground investigation field according to Appendix 1 (SC-GIFW). The curriculum vitae of the GFT/CP (loggings & supervision) would be submitted separately.

During predrilling, drilling rig would mount parallel to the track direction and the casing would also be lifted in parallel to reduce falling risks to the track area. The operator raises the mast slowly by increasing the pressure of the mast hydraulic cylinder. Then the mast legs would only be fixed at the designated position and safety pin would be inserted to secure and lock the mast in vertical direction before releasing the pressure at the hydraulic jack. During lowering procedure of the mast, the operator should be gradually increasing the pressure of the hydraulic cylinder to hold the mast by which the safety pin at the backstay legs can only be removed. Then by releasing the hydraulic cylinder, The rig mast can gradually lower until it’s in a horizontal position.

Step 4: Repeat Step 1 to 3 until touch drilling hole bottom

The operator will perform the inspection with checklist “Drill Weekly Checklist”. The checklist can refer to Appendix E.

Below sketch shown the set up for predrilling

Generally, the water would be first treated and then conveyed to the Wetsep prior releasing to the nearest gullies. The drainage can refer to below: 

For the full layout of water discharge, please refer to the separate method statement of discharge water.

The drill hole will be performed by rotary method using skid-mounted rotary drilling rigs and water as flushing medium. The drilling technique utilized a drill head swivel providing rotation when coupled with drill rods. The ground condition will be checked by the drilling operator, geotechnical field technician with area foreman before mobilise and unloading the drilling rig. The hydraulic feed-type drilling rig with sufficient capacity will be mounted on stable ground, enabling the rig to operate with minimum movement and thus improve the accuracy in drill hole orientation.

Workers would be briefed that no canvas shall be erected as sun shield or for any purpose on site at any time not just linking to drilling rig not allow to prevent the canvas from blowing off to other track area. Water tank and wetsep would be provided to recycle the water as much as possible. Water would be treated first at Wetsep and would then be discharged to nearest manhole and discharged finally near the box culvert. Prior approval from Depot is required to discharge into existing manhole in SHD. 

When the termination level achieved, the last rock sample shall be obtained under the supervision of the MTR Representative and the depth of the drill hole shall be measured by the MTR Representative.

All the flushing water generated during drilling work will be collected and pumped to sedimentation tank for recycling and will be pumped back to the drill holes

After obtaining the last rock sample and complying with the termination requirement, Geologist shall log the drill hole information with soil and rock description. The logged information shall then be passed to the Geotechnical Engineer Representative for drill hole report preparation.

## 7.4 Sampling

By using the rigs hydraulics, the drilling carriage is raised and the sampler is screwed and attached onto the anvil adaptor. The carriage is then lowered until the tentative sampling level. The hydraulic cylinder of the drilling rig is lowered and the drop-weight is activated, driving the sampler into the ground. Once the sampling tube has been driven to its full length, the hydraulic cylinder is activated pulling the sampler from the ground.

After retrieval of sample, casing will be drilled for the flushing cleaning of hole before next sampling. Then, sampling will be continued by successively adding drill rods between the sampler the anvil adaptor.

## 7.5 Sample Handling

All Core samples shall be stored in core boxes which shall be of sound robust timber construction and be able to withstand the weight of the cores. The Contract numbers, drill hole number, depth, date of drilling shall be clearly marked on the side, inside and outside lid of the core box with permanent ink. Rope strands shall be attached to the core box for lifting. Core boxes shall be made with rigid separating wooden slats and shall be about 1.0m long. The core boxes shall be stored off site at TY and protected with plastic cover sheet. 

### 7.6 In-situ Test

Standard Penetration Tests

For pre-drill hole, Standard Penetration Tests (SPT) will be commenced from 3.0 m below ground level or immediately at the base of the inspection pit and thereafter at the 2.0m intervals in the drill holes within common ground.

The tests will be carried out in accordance with BS1377:1990. The SPT hammer comprises a 63.5 kg donut hammer with automatic trip mechanism and drop height of 760mm. The results will be given on the daily site and drill hole records. The 'N' value given on the drill hole records will be the number of blows required to drive the split barrel sampler through 300mm (after completion of the seating drive). If full penetration is not achieved, the number of blows and corresponding penetration will be indicated accordingly.
