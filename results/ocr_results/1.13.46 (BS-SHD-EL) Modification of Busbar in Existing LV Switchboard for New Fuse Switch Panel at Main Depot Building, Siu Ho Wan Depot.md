Photo of Proposed Fuse Switch Panel and Busbar Installations

The above sketch and photo indicate the proposed installation of new fuse switch panel adjacent to existing MSB-2.2 and the routing of connecting busbar and associated containment extending from Panel 12. The clearance between new fuse switch panel and opened access door to Transformer Room have been considered while taking place, so the new panel will not obstruct the opening of access door to Transformer Room. Also, there should be a minimum height clearance of 2200mm between ground and bottom of new busbar to ensure the sufficient access space under the busbar section.

<!-- Routing of New Busbar Trunking Layout  -->

The new busbar will be tee-off from riser busbar in Panel 12 of MSB-2.2 and extended from the opening on MSB-2.2 to the top of proposed fuse switch panel as shown on above sketch. All busbar run and connecting point will be completely enclosed in the busbar trunking.

The new fuse switch panel will be in floor stand type and fabricated by LVSB sub-contractor. After the fabrication, the new fuse switch panel will be delivered to the LV switch room. The delivery routing has indicated in below layout. Also, the new busbar trunking will be installed accordingly.
