card according to the direction indicated by the notch. After that, re-tighten the 2 screws at the bottom of the camera to complete the installation.

Step 2: Choose the right mounting point

The first step is to survey the site and find a suitable point for CCTV installation. Selection of points generally have the following principles:

- Installation angle as far as possible so that the area to be monitored falls within the scope of the camera focus clear;

- Installation height will exceed the height of the human body, to avoid too low to be man-made damage, too high to be bad maintenance;

Step 3: Install the camera and solar panel

The CCTV is mounted directly on the lamp pole or concrete blocks with pole. Generally, the height of CCTV mounted on the lamp pole will be 6m and to be installed by aid of cherry picker. The height of CCTV mounted on a concrete block with pole would be 3m to be installed by aid of platform ladder.

Install solar panel by using the hexagonal wrench to fix the solar panel on the support arm.

Mount camera by using two screws to fix the camera to the bracket first. Then pass the hoop through the pole and tighten the hoop screws to secure the bracket to the pole.

Loosen vertical and horizontal adjustment screws, adjust the camera to desired scene to be monitored, tighten the adjustment screws, and complete the installation.

7.2.3 Network connection of solar panel CCTV camera

(1) General Network Connection System

According to the existing CCTV layout plan, the wireless network linking could be achieved by using Leap X, Network Receiver and Wireless Bridge. The fundamental topology theory of the network is similar as tree diagram: (1) The network of the whole system is received by Network Receiver then transit to relatively nearer wireless bridge and CCTV camera via cable/fiber. (2) The network of further Leap X and CCTV/C-Smart camera will be linked by the signal of wireless bridge via cable/fiber. (3) The rest of CCTV/C-Smart cameras are going to link to network by 5.8G Leap X network. The following is the draft network connection system for 1701.

Alternative Network Connection

For those area couldn’t connect to the network system, SIM card(s) will be adopted with the following specification or similar to the CCTV camera(s).
