**Lifting Arrangement** 

No part of the mobile crane/crane lorry will work beyond the water filled barrier or RP fence and the maximum lifting load shall be &lt;80% of the SWL. 

The ground condition shall be checked to ensure firm and level ground in advance of the arrival of the lifting equipment to site by the WPIC / banksman. The outrigger positions will be marked and the ground shall be thoroughly checked to ensure sufficient load bearing capacity at the working location to support the crane. A visual inspection and utility detection will be carried out to ensure that the mobile crane/crane lorry is not bearing onto any underground services. If this cannot be avoided, the utility will be protected by means of steel plates or spreader mats designed to safeguard against any damage.The weight of the lifting gear must be counted as part of the lifting load. 

For all lifting operations, the mobile crane / crane lorry outriggers must be fully extended and the unsafe zone fenced off.

**Worker Verification** 

⚫ All workers will be bored shuttle buses from a designated area such as Tung Chung Station.

⚫ During boarding of the shuttle bus, hand-held facial recognition will be performed to verify the worker's qualification. 

⚫ The facial recognition system will check if the person has passed the RSI and possesses a green card. 

⚫ A list of workers shall be submitted to MTR for registration before starting of works. The list shall be updated weekly and available for MTR as requested.

Uniform and Safety Equipment: All workers shall wear PPE with standard uniform and safety helmet for easy recognition by the security guards and YM.

**Gate Arrangement** 

During construction, access to the work areas will be via the existing Gate EAG4, EAG5 and Proposed Gate TT06, TT07 and TT0A. All the gates will be closed and locked by our C-SMART security system outside of NPH and we will provide the key to the Depot DCC/IMD for the proposed gates TT06, TT07and TT0A.

## 8.2 Construction Sequence

### 8.2.1 Setting Out 

#### 8.2.1.1 The location for sheet pile installation shall be set out in advance for UU detection and checked to ensure no underground live services and utilities are present. UU detection and inspection is described under a separate method statement submission.

#### 8.2.1.2 Inspection pits shall be excavated by hand to identify any existing underground utility services where required.

#### 8.2.1.3 The piling area shall be prepared as reasonably level and firm for the safe manoeuvring of the sheet piles and heavy plant by on site inspection conducted by the WPIC / Foreman. The adequacy of the ground bearing capacity for the loads imposed by the mobile crane/ crane lorry shall be checked and wooden spreader pads shall be provided as required at each outrigger position before the plant / crane enters the work area. The briefing record given before commencement of lifting work shall considered as the endorsed confirmation record.

#### 8.2.1.4 The setting out points shall be confirmed by the architectural and structural drawings.

### 8.2.1.5 A pre-work condition record and non-destructive utilities’ service detection by UU competent person of the Cable bridge shall be taken and submitted for future reference prior to commencing work. The excavation extent shall be marked on site before commencement of works near the existing Cable Bridges. 

### 8.2.2 Installation Method of Steel Sheet Piles 

### 8.2.2.1 The sheet piles shall be installed into the ground by press-in method with a silent piler mounted on piling rig and 12 ton crawler crane as assisted with min. 2m in width for transportation and 3.81m for working status as lifted over test track by 75 ton mobile crane. The sheet pile layout plan is enclosed in Appendix D and Figure 5.1 to 5.6 above for easy reference. The work shall be undertaken in accordance with the BD approved plan.

8.2.2.2 The standard press-in method shall be adopted for the silent pile. In case any hard material is encountered during sheet pile installation, the super crush mode, rotary drilling or equivalent method shall be adopted as attached in the catalogue in **Appendix C.** 

### 8.2.2.3 In the event of an obstruction being encountered during the installation of the sheet pile wall, pre-boring will be necessary.

### 8.2.2.4 Welding procedures shall be submitted and approved by the AP/RSE/RGE before commencement of works. All welders shall be qualified and will have demonstrated their competence in welding to this agreed procedure and have been tested as descried in BS EN 287 Part 1: 2004.

### 8.2.3 Pre-boring works (If necessary)

### 8.2.3.1 Pre-boring shall be carried out where necessary to overcome an underground obstruction.Pre-boring is also required at locations where sheet pile installation can cause vibration on adjacent structures exceeding the requirement stipulated in PNAP APP-137 with the vibration limit as stipulated in APP-24 shall also be complied with.

### 8.2.3.2 Pre-bored holes shall be sunk along the alignment of the sheet pile wall. The pre-bored holes shall be supported by a temporary steel casing along the full depth of the drilling.

### 8.2.3.3 Pre-bored holes shall be drilled in accordance with the following requirements –

i. Deviation from the correct line for the location of the pre-bored holes at existing ground level within 25mm.

## ii. Deviation from vertically of individual pre-bored holes in any direction: less than 1:100.

### 8.2.3.4 After drilling through to the required depth of obstructions, the interior of each casing shall be filled with approved granular material as the temporary casing is withdrawn. Any drop in

Figure 8.2.1 Typical arrangement of pre-boring works8.2.4 Procedures for Installation of Steel Sheet Piles 8.2.4.1 The length of the sheet pile shall comply with the approved BD drawings with length of 6m to 12m depending on proximity to the track. The pile shall be marked in 1 m intervals before use. Sitting plan for the 12T crawler crane as attached in Appendix C and lifting arrangement is shown in Figure 8.2.1A and 8.2.1B. The lifting plan and general lifting plan across the Test Track shall be approved under separate submission.</td>

### 8.2.4.2 Position the Sheet Pile along the setting out alignment and start installation from one end by silent piler mounted on the piling rig. 

### 8.2.4.3 Press the Sheet Pile into ground until the desired sheet pile toe level is reached.

8.2.4.4 Splice each sheet pile by full penetration butt weld all round and a Grade 275 75x100x8mm thick splice plate and inspect on completion as shown **Figure 8.2.3**  with non-destructive test frequency as shown in **Figure 8.2.6** .

### 8.2.4.5 The verticality of the sheet pile wall will be measured by spirit level.

### 8.2.4.6 The founding levels of the sheet pile wall shall be confirmed and agreed with the AP/RSE/RGE representative by site inspection.

### 8.2.4.7 Each sheet pile is to be welded together with 6mm fillet weld (weld length = 500mm from top of sheet pile) during excavation of the first 1m (maximum) below existing ground as refer to the BD approved drawings as shown in Figure 8.2.3. A lifting eye shall be designed for sheet pile installation and approved by our Independent Checking Engineer.
