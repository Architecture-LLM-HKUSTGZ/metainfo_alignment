The value of HDOP of satellites received during the survey will be monitored and recorded.

8.2 Preparation of Plan lines

Pre-assigned survey lines will be allocated to cover the entire sounding portion. The principle of designing the survey lines would either be 5m section intervals normal to the base line or 5m fixed intervals. In addition, reasonable check lines shall be performed normal to the survey line. The interval of check line usually adopted as 40m or minimal of 2-3 check lines to be adopted. 

8.3 Field Survey

Survey vessel speed will be kept in a constant speed, generally 3-5 knots will be applied which causing no intolerable distortion to the sounding records. The software will be set to mark on the data file and sounding paper in every 5m. The interval will be set in distance instead of time because the sampling rate by time had been affected by speed of the boat. The marks would be evenly distributed along the cross section if marks were taken by distance intervals. The sounding will be recorded in the computer by 0.1s intervals; it means 0.15m intervals at speed of 3 knot. A minimum of 2-3 check lines should be run for ensure the quality of the sounding data.

8.4 Tide Reading

The closest government tide gauge Chek Lap Kok will be constantly booked during the period of the survey with readings being taken in 10 minutes interval throughout that period.

**TECHNOLOGY FOR ** 

**CABLE-FREE SYSTEM ** 

**SUB-METER ACCURACY AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE**  The Trimble SPS356 DGNSS/Beacon Receiver is an economical answer to the many demands of marine construction. It incorporates tried and tested DGNSS positioning technology in a robust package with an easy to use interface. Combined with Trimble HYDROpro™ software, it provides flexibility for a wide range of marine construction applications, including:

 •Dredging

 •Positioning (tugs / anchors)

 •Navigation

 •Rock and material placement

 •Bathymetric survey

**Trimble Tough. Trimble Secure** 

The robust construction and modularity of the SPS356 system delivers installation flexibility as required on marine vessel installations. The receiver can be mounted in a secure environment protected from the weather and theft, leaving only the antenna outside. Trimble EVEREST™ technology improves results in high multi-path environments such as those encountered on construction vessels and port construction sites.

**Accuracy at All Times and All Places** 

The Trimble SPS356 receiver can achieve DGNSS positioning with sub-meter precision using RTCM DGNSS corrections either broadcast free by IALA MSK Beacon stations, via the Internet from an NTRIP source, from SBAS (satellite based augmentation systems) such as WAAS, EGNOS and MSAS or via an external radio from a local reference station. The RTCM correction stream from an MSK source can be passed to other DGNSS receivers using the Repeat RTCM function.

**Easier from Start to Finish** 

Serial, Ethernet, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capability combined with standard NMEA output protocols mean that it can easily be integrated into solutions, is easier to manage remotely, and allows easy access to the data and functions of the receiver.

**A Family of Site Positioning Systems to Fit JobRequirements** 

The SPS356 receiver is part of the family of Trimble site positioning system products with common interface, connectors and interchangeable accessories This system approach helps reduce product training and part stocking. For large companies managing multiple sites around the world it increases operational flexibility and reduces the need for knowledge of different systems for different applications through deployment of a common userinterface.

**ECHOTRAC™** 

**MKIII MODEL** 

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

Like to keep your options open? Then Odom’s Echotrac™MKIII is the echo sounder for you! It’s the only sounder on the market offering you the choice of either a high-resolution thermal paper recorder or a full-sized high bright color LCD chart in interchangeable module format. 

When it comes from Odom, you know it’s durable, easy to use and backed by the best customer service in the industry. Both high and low channels feature frequency agility,enabling the operator to precisely match the transceiver to almost any existing transducer. This matching ability minimizes nearsurface noise caused by transducer ringing while increasing echo return strength. 

The MKIII is capable of both shallow and deep-water operations and it features unsurpassed interfacing exibility with four serial ports and high speed Ethernet capability for maximum efciency. With all of these features in such a compact and portable package, it’s easy to see why the Echotrac™ MKIII is such a respected echo sounder.
