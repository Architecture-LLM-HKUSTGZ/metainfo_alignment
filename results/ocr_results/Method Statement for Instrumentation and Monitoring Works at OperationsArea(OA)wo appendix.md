1.  Introduction (Overview of the operation/works)

According to the working drawing and BD approval drawing instrumentation and monitoring shall be installed before commencement of the piling works. The instrumentation monitoring (I&M) points should be installed in influence zone that may be affected during construction work. The regular settlement monitoring will be conducted during construction period. Since most of the I&M points are located in the Operations Area (OA), this method statement mainly covered instrumentation monitoring in OA the such as Mainline Bifurcation, OYB Station, SPS, L-Shape Ramp and Drainage & Sewerage Construction Works. Method statement for installation at CA shall be submitted separately. Refer to the layout plan as below. Amendments to this Method Statement to address comments of previous versions are shown highlighted in yellow.

This method statement will show type, sequence and method of installation instrumentation monitoring at OA, the I&M in Construction Areas (CAs) would be submitted separately.

7 Test Track Crossing Arrangement

While the proposed gates 6, 7 and A are not ready, we will use the existing gates EAG 4, 5 &50.84U MAG to access the works area for carrying out the monitoring marker installation and preparation.

For Test Track and Bifurcation Area (area between Test Track and Mainline), the access shall be via existing gates no. EAG 4 & 5, and liaise with Depot Control and TC.

For Mainline, the access should be used 50.84U MAG and liaise with OCC and TC.

The proposed gate no. 6, 7 and A crossing arrangements as follows:

<!-- 6A7AAA 6B7BAB  -->

7.1 CP(T) should stand by at each Proposed Access Gate to manage the access control, operate the gate manually and keep the corresponding Gate Key.

7.2 There are 3 pairs of Gates with 6 CP(T) provided at: CP(T) — 1 at Gate 6A; CP(T) — 2 at Gate 7A; CP(T) — 3 at Gate AA; CP(T) — 4 at Gate 6B CP(T) — 5 at Gate 7B; CP(T) - 6 at Gate AB;

7.3 CP(T) — 1 should be shall be report to the DYM before commencement of works and he/she is single point of contact with DYM/ EPIC. He /she should also communicate with CP(T) —2,CP(T)-3,CP(T)-4,CP(T) — 5 and CP(T) — 6 and ensure that the open/ close of all access gates are synchronized.

7.4 Each group will be CP(T), WPIC, 3 to 4 nos of workers

7.7 Physical barriers (water-filled barriers without panel) will be used for demarcated the works area to ensure CSHK workers will not be able to go from the work site on/ near test track 

into the on mainline area (Permissions from MTR OCC TC are required via DCC prior to the commencement of the work on/ near test track).

Transportation Arrangement

For standpipe, piezometer located in the operations area (OAs) between test track and mainline,drilling rigs is required. There are few delivery methods were as follows:

8.1 Lifting Operation at South Road (Method 1) (The lifting plan will be submitted separately)50 Ton mobile crane would be adopted to transplant the drilling rig to work area. The actual size may vary slightly suit the available the arranged plant. Also, the lifting operation will be submitted to MTR for approval before start. The lifting operation included ground condition checking, lifting plan with calculation. The typical lifting plan, section plan and calculation as follows:


<table border="1" ><tr>
<td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td>
</tr><tr>
<td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td>
</tr></table>

8.2 The 50 Ton mobile crane will setup at the South Road at Night Time. The ground conditions shall be checked by ICE for the 50 Ton mobile crane lifting operation and submit to MTR.

<!-- *Two tag lines shall be tie at  lifting object before lifting. Tag line  -->

8.3 Lifting Weight Calculation, check the lifting object weight included LAGA weights, ensure the weight not more than the 80% Capacity of Mobile Crane.

CALCULATION

Drilling rig weight=1.4 tons

3008s75kg 170cu ou

Crane lorry lifting capacity =13.4tons@14.6m

8.4.5.2 The hydraulic mast cylinder must be completely depressurized, confirmed by the position of the mast raise/lower lever and visual inspection by the operator.The two backstay legs should be fixed in designed position of the drilling rig.

8.4.5.3 Others stand near the drilling rig during mast raising operation should not allowed. The operator raises the mast slowly by increase the pressure of the mast hydraulic cylinder, and monitor two backstay legs remain fixed in right position.

8.4.7 Lifting Method for the Loose Materials

Double tagline attached at the lifting objects before lifting.

Method 1

For rigging stabilization, the tiedown straps will be used to tie the drill casings with hanger together; connect the hook with anchoring point is secured (the anchoring point must be structurally sound tested and examined by a competent examiner).

<!-- Anch  -->

Anchoring points

Method 2

Prevent slipping or displacement of any loose objects or loads during lifting.Double wrap choker hitch method will be adopted.

Track trolleys are to be used for the transportation of dismantled drilling rig parts near the existing building AB23. The transportation and set-up of drill rig is as follow: 

a. One bay of wire mesh fence will be fenced off by water barrier near AB23 and then temporarily removed to form the temporarily access to Test Track. 

b. The track trolleys will then be loaded on Test Track.

c. The parts of drilling rig will be loaded on the track trolleys and transported to the required location between Test Track and mainline. 

d. The wire mesh will be reinstalled after the transportation of parts each day.

This document is controlled in soft copy.

Any hard copies seen are uncontrolled unless Page 16 of 51

e. The drilling rig will be assembled on site and certified by RPE. After that, the drilling rig is ready to work. 

f. The temporary access and routing of track trolley refer to Appendix Track Trolley

8.6 Manual Handling (Method 3)

For easy manual handling, the drilling rig will be dismantled into small parts (drilling rigs, water tank (empty) and casing with hanger), and materials/ casing will be divided into small sizes. The small parts of the drilling rig will be transported to bifurcation area via the existing gate no. 4 & 

5. The drilling rig will be assembled on site and certified by RPE. After that, the drilling rig is ready to work.

The largest part weight of the drilling rigs should be ~200kg, and min. 6 nos. of workers to carrying.
