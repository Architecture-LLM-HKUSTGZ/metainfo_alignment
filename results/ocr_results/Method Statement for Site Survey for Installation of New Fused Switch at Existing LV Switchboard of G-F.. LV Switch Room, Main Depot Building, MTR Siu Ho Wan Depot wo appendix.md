Elevation of LV Switchboard MSB-2.1 & MSB-2.2

During busbar measurement,a temporary power suspension is required. The affected circuit is highlighted in yellow as per Appendix A. The affected services should be verified on site.

Procedure of Measurement

Preparation:

1. Work Notice Form and registration on Engineering Works and Traffic Information Management System (ETMS) shall be submitted by CSCE.

2. An exact date has been further coordinated with relevant parties and stated in Section 5 -"Programme and Working Hours" of this method statement.

Before Measurement:

1. To ensure the Work Notice Form and ETMS registration have been accepted.

2. To ensure method statement and risk assessment have been accepted by MTR.

3. To ensure Permit-to-Work (PTW) has been issued by REW before carrying out works.

4. Warning labels should be displayed to remind that electrical works is in progress.

5. To ensure detail schedule of work activities have been accepted as attached in Appendix B.

6. To ensure emergency communication lines have been established.

7. If necessary, the F.S. systems, such as direct link and FM200 protected room will be isolated before any switching.

8. CP is responsible to supervise and brief to the workers about LV switchboard to be inspected and the potential risks.

9. CP shall ensure all team members well understand their corresponding accountabilities and responsibilities for the tasks.

10. Temporary earthing bonding shall be provided and connected between existing LV switchboard and earthing terminal in prior.

11.A live line test should be conducted before applying earthing, and electrical insulating gloves should be worn during the installation of temporary earthing.

12. The rear of panel 7 of MSB 2.2 (panel for incomer SHD504) should not be opened during the inspection work. Temporary barriers and warning signage should be placed.

<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13. CP and workers shall sign the briefing record for identification and record as attached inAppendix C.14. CP & WPIC shall ensure all workers and team members are well equipped with personalprotection equipment (PPE) including hard helmets, safety shoes, reflective vests, and insulatinggloves for the tasks.15. CP & WPIC shall notify te depot/yard master prior the work.16. Power shut down of the LV switchboard will be arranged, implementation of Lock-Out Tag-Out(L.O.T.O.) procedure as attached in Appendix D. All outgoing load fused switches will beswitched off manually one by one, and the incoming ACB SHD504 and Section ACB 533 will beswitched off by remote control from Power System Controller (PSC). These ACBs will be alsolocked by REW to prevent re-energisation. The key of the ACBs will be kept by the REW.17.Check the all live parts have been shut down, isolation, proofing dead by using of meter,applyingof portable earth lead(s) of circuit in order to fulfil operational needs or facilitate electrical works.During Measurement:1. Ensure electrical power of ACB is isolated in remote control by Power Supply Controller (PSC)before carrying out work.2. Open the back panel cover of LV switchboard.3. Measure the busbar of existing LV switchboard.4. Photos shall be taken for record.After Measurement:1.Make sure all the tools and equipment are removed and cleared away from Panel nos. 8 and 12of Switchboard MSB 2.22. Reinstate the back coves of Panel nos. 8 and 12 of Switchboard MSB 2.2 and check that thepanel is fully enclosed.3. The LV switchboard will be re-energised, in accordance with the Lock-Out Tag-Out procedure.The incoming ACBs will be drawn into the cradle and switched on by remote control from PowerSystem Controller (PSC). Then, the outgoing MCCBs will be switched on one by one.4. Check whether the power supply to each area is normal. If there are any abnormalities with theelectrical installation, switchboard sub-contractor will provide technical support for the LVswitchboard within 30 minutes after re-energisation.5. Confirm the whole system has returned normal and Permit-to-Work shall be cancelled by APafterwards.</td>
