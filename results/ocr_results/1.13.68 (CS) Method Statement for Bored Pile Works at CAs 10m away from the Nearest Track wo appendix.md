### 7.2.2 General Access to works at W11 & W12

The delivery of plants and equipment shall be passed through the vehicular access bridge,we would also temporarily utilize west gate (or east gate) via the west level crossing to deliver those plants and materials of delivery height shall be restricted or less than 4.0m (e.g up to 80 ton crawler crane and 3.0m dia. steel casing) unless prior agreement obtained from the Depot. During delivery from West gate, escort vehicle with CPs would be deployed to escort the construction vehicles. CP(T) would be stationed at the West Gate to check the vehicular height and direct the traffic and communicate with the yard master continuously. Apart from the construction vehicles, shuttle escorted by escort vehicle would be arranged to directly carry the worker from West Gate to the Container Village at W11 via the West level crossing.

We would also utilize the East gate with the same height limit, similar safety procedure same as West Gate would be deployed. The necessary permits/forms adhered to the main contractor or MTRC will be filled up prior to the access of the machinery and machinery inspection to be carried out by the safety personnel and relevant party. Nonetheless, we would hold regular workshops with RP/Yard master to go through current works within all CAs in order to identify and review any impact upon railway and/or depot operation. The rules and procedures for Railway Protection under the Railway Ordinance will be in accordance with Practice Note for Authorized Persons, Registered Structural Engineers and Registered Geotechnical Engineers (PNAP ADV-33 / APP-24) and MTRCL working paper No.6-Railway Protection-Revision B-December 2022.

The detail of general logistics should refer to the submitted security and traffic management plan.

W11 would be divided into 3 major sections and at each section there will be an individual WPIC to supervise the construction activities. Each section would be fenced off and there will be also multiple gate openings reserved for exit and entry to prevent labours going around the site.

For the proposed layout of the logistic plan for the bored pilling works can refer to the Appendix I for the arrangement.

## 7.2.3 Logistics Arrangement: Temp Water and Electricity Supply

During first few months of the project, temporary water would be sourced from the water pipe along the south road to W11.A 200mm recessed would be formed to bury the water pipe to across the South Road which is subjected to depot's approval and we would follow depot's procedure for obtaining the water.

After connection to WSD water point at Tai Ho interchange, water pipe would be connected from Tai Ho Interchange and to W11 via the West level Crossing. Detail of connecting through the West Level Crossing shall refer to separate submission. Multiple location of Wetsep across the W11 and W12 to discharge the treated waste water. Below shown the sketch for the provision. Wetseps location at W11 and W12 are shown below. The water would be treated first at Wetsep and then discharged into nearest manhole which eventually leads to discharge of box culvert.

And Fire Extinguishershall be provided.Adverse Weather ConditionAdverse weather condition such as storm and strong wind, the crane activity shall stop immediatelyand leave the lifting item on the ground.If wind speeds exceeding 20 m/s (45 mph) or gale force 8 are expected, the entire boom must beplaced flat on the ground. It is always preferable to lay down the boom completely, as this is the safestcourse of action. On top of that, the main boom shall always be laid down in the direction of thewind. If,for reasons of space, it is only possible to lay the main boom down at right angles to the winddirection, then it must be laid down before the wind speed reaches 20 m/s.If stormy weather is either prevailing or forecast and if there will be a break in work of one workingday or more, or also if the crane operator and assistants are likely to be off-site, then the whole boomshould normally be laid down on the ground.</td>
