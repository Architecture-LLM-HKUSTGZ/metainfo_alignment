Station Structure are located in between the existing test track and mainline. In order to provide the man and vehicle access to the island site in Area W2, 
(see Figure 1), entrance gates shall be formed at existing railway protection fence of test track, and temporary level crossing will be proposed to install at the existing Test Track.

Figure 1 - Site Photo showing the Work area W2 at Test Track and TCL/AEL Mainline

## 4.3 Description A. General

1701 Contractor will carry out the works for the temporary entrance and level crossing installation as per correlated latest version of the approved Method Statement for Site Entrance, Level Crossing and Cross Road Duct at Test Track for OYB Station Northern Structure, Bifurcation Area and Depot Edge Pile under **ACC Ref No. 1701-W-000-CSC-760-000473**. Precaution measures for various potential risks/ situation have been reviewed and summarized in the hazard log referring to Appendix B.

## B. Working Time

Test Track: 3 night time (Friday^Saturday, Saturday^Sunday and one on weekday) per week or NPH ( 11:00 to 15 :00 ) subject to Depot Schedule;

## C. Preparation Work

Before commencement of the installation, the following works shall be completed.

## C.1 Setting Out

The location of entrance gates and level crossing will be set out at the co-ordinates shown on the Construction Drawings or as agreed with MTR's representatives on site. 

Contract 1701 - Site Entrance and Level Crossing at Test Track for OYB Station Northern Structure, Bifurcation Area and Depot Edge Pile Issue/Rev.1 / 0 Once the location has been set out a joint inspection will be held with MTR's representatives on site, Depot Yard Master (DYM) and other stakeholders. Referring to the railway safety requirements and construction drawings, the proposed level crossings or entrance gates are close to existing trackside equipment, CSHK will further verify the site conditions with MTR/ (DYM) representatives onsite.

## C.2 Existing Water Supply And Utility Diversion

Existing water supply and utility along the at the existing railway protection fence of Test Track shall be diverted or lowered down below ground level at the locations of proposed entrance. 

## C.3 Cable Detection

Utility detection and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey will be arrived out after the area is fenced off and after the obstacle above ground are cleared. The details of carrying out utility detection shall follow the approved Method Statement for General Underground Utility Survey for Construction Area (ACC Reference Number: 
1701/W/000/CSC/760/000095). Based on the master drawings of all utilities, it shows that only one cable is found in this area.

## C.4 Trial Pit

Trial Pits will be carried out in accordance with Permit-to-Dig System before start of the works. For details, please refer to separate submissions ACC no. 170-W-000-CSC-760-000115.

## C.5 Utility Diversion/ Abandoned Works

Any utilities required diversion or to be abandoned will be carried out with relevant approved EDOC prior to start the instrumentation installation works.

## C.6 Pre-Construction Survey

Pre-construction survey, Survey and UU detection will be carried out and completed before the commencement of the works, survey of existing MTR equipment at ground level. Reports to be submitted to MTR, showing the protections applying to the MTR equipment.

## C.7 Instrumentation And Monitoring

Setting up instrumentation monitoring plan and taking initial readings as per the BD approved drawings. The method statement for setting up instrumentation monitoring is described in 'Method Statement for Instrumentation and Monitoring Works at Operations Area (OA)' (ACC Reference Number 1701/W/000/CSC/760/000122), EDOC for Instrumentation and Monitoring Works (ACC Reference Number 1701- 
Contract 1701 - Site Entrance and Level Crossing at Test Track for OYB Station Northern Structure, Bifurcation Area and Depot Edge Pile Issue/Rev.1 / 0 W-000-CSC-143-000284) and (EDOC Reference Number ZCV20240) 
and 'Method Statement for Instrumentation and Monitoring Works at Construction Area (CA)' (ACC Reference Number 1701/W/000/CSC/760/000138). For those standpipe and piezometer, it will be installed at the location which are 10 meters far away from the existing live tracks. AAA Levels will be used for the monitoring works in drawings no. C1701/B/OYB/OAP/C06/101, Oyster Bay Station - Geotechnical Instrumentation and Monitoring General Notes for Foundation Works at Southern Structure (Non–railway structures), and C1701/B/SHD/OAP/C06/102, Oyster Bay Station - Geotechnical Instrumentation and Monitoring General Notes for Foundation Works at Southern Structure (Railway structures). A monitoring sequence can be found and will be used for the monitoring works in drawings no.

## D. Installation Procedure

In general, three locations of C with gates are proposed at the South

![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png) Road along the existing Test Track. They are named TT06, TT07 and TT0A and their width are 6.3m, 6.3m & 7m respectively, see **Figure 2** 
and 3 below :

Figure 3 - Site Photo showing the location of entrance TT07 and TT0A

![5_image_1.png](5_image_1.png)

The installation method and sequence of new entrances and the temporary level crossings are as follows:
i. Before the commencement of the entrance gate and temporary level 

![5_image_2.png](5_image_2.png)

crossing installation, existing water supply pipe/ utility along the existing railway protection fence will be diverted and lowered down below ground level.

Install high gauge in front of existing RP fence. As discussed in the RP/HKTS meeting, the allowable maximum height shall be 3.8m.

ii. Install temporary security/protective fence before cut openings at existing RP fence
