6.2 Topography Survey

Topography Survey along SSK Drive for the Feasibility Study on Temporary Widening will be carried out along the SSK Drive (approx. 870m) with the planned extent shown in Appendix A. In which, the as-built road profile, existing ground level, location of existing features shall be recorded by survey team. The information will be used to determine the extent of temporary widening of SSK Drive.
