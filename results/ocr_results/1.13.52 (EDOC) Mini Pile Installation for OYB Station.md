Figure 8.0.5 and Figure 8.0.6 show the relationship for mini-pile installation and the existing track works. 

**Figure 8.0.6**  **–**  **Section B –**  **B (G.L. S20)** 

Common materials to be lifted are steel casing and bar for mini-pile. Lifting plan refers to separate method statement for General Lifting Plan. Considering the failure of clamping the steel casing during drilling, the sitting orientation of the drilling rig should parallel with AEL/TCL Track. That way, even if the steel casing falls down, it falls to the side instead of falling towards AEL/TCL Track. (referring to Figure 8.0.7)

## 8.2 Procedures of Mini-Pile Construction

a. The exact location of mini-pile should be set out and conduct inspection pit under separate submission with Utilities Detection Report under the construction area under separate method statement. Permit to dig shall be submitted before drilling. No 2 pile shall be constructed simultaneously within 10m plan distance. 45 ton mobile crane shall be adopted for lifting work within work-front. (Refer to separate method statement for general lifting work). Setting out plan as shown in Figure 8.2.1.

b. A grade S275 mild steel permanent casing shall follow the drill bit down to bedrock level, and the casing shall not be withdrawn. Full penetration butt weld will be the connection of the permanent steel casings under the BD approved drawings.

c. Construction tolerances are as follows: 

Setting out tolerance at top of mini-pile to be ±15mm and inclination tolerance to be 1:100 from the longitudinal pile axis. The tolerances will be closely monitored by setting out survey and spirit level checking with joint inspection prior to the grouting work commence.

d. After reaming of the rock socket to the required depth, the hole shall be flushed with clean water to remove any debris.

e. Grout tubes shall be tied to the whole length of the reinforcement which shall consist of 5 nos T50 high yield steel bars with 12m of length per each rebar with staggering of couplers must be minimum 200mm as per approved BD drawing. 20mm clearance between the bars shall be achieved by spacers and continuity of reinforcement shall be achieved by using couplers in a staggered arrangement along the full length of the pile. Sitting plan for the rebar please refer to Figure 8.2.1 as shown below. For the location within the abutment of the existing viaduct after Gridline S10, the lifting radius should keep at least 200mm clearance as shown to Figure 8.2.2.

f.

**Figure 8.2.1 –**  **Set up of sitting plan by Reaction Piles (For information only)** 

g. During installation and drilling for the mini-pile, verticality, inclination and alignment of the mini-piles should be closely monitored. Method statement shall be submitted for approval prior to commencement of the works. Records of test result shall be submitted to Project Manager prior to concreting and results shall satisfy the allowable tolerances and dimension

h. Advance casing to 300mm below bedrock level or such other depths as required to avoid caving of soil at the interface of soil and sound bedrock during cleaning of the rock socked whilst maintaining verticality check.

## i. Form the rock socket of minimum 240mm diameter to the founding level as required using down the hole drilling method with air as the flushing medium or other method approved by Project Manager.

j. The 5 numbers T50 high yield bars shall be placed centrally in the hole and couplers shall be used to extend the reinforcement. No more than 3 couplers shall be placed at the same level.Coupler shall be submitted with another material submission and the installation method shall be approved under separate submission.

k. The mini-pile shall be tremie grouted under water in one continuous operation. Cement gou is pumped by pressure from the top of the hole and displacing water upwards form the bottom.

l. Adequate safety precautions shall be taken during construction of piles in close proximity of the existing buildings. Safety precautionary measures should be submitted to Project Manager before commencement of works.

## 8.3 Reaction Pile (For proof tension load test of mini-pile)

Due to insufficient area for carrying out pile load testing, reaction pile shall be proposed.

⚫ Post-construction proof drilling shall be conducted with at least 2 number of drill holes to verify the quality of the rock forming of rock socket.

⚫ Selection of proof-tension load test by Building Authority after submission of BA14. For the method statement of loading test, we shall submit under separate submission.
