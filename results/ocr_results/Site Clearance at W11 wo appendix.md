<!-- . Introduction (Overview of the operation/works) This method statement describes the method and sequence of Site clearance at W11 area.  After handover work areas to CSHK, work areas shall be fenced off before construction works  commence. Site clearance at W11 will commence using a 13-20 tons backhoe, grab lorry and crane  lorry. This document shall be distributed to relevant parties to introduce the work scopes, to present the  sequence of works and to define the associated responsibilities to ensure the health, safety,  environment and quality issues addressed. The details of the procedures contained herewith shall  be reviewed periodically and updated base on the actual site conditions. The principle methods as  described in the following sections are subject to review during construction and may be amended  if required. Layout Plan for W11 site clearance  -->

7. Construction Methods / Construction Sequence Drawings

Preparation 

- All works before commencement must contact depot YM to get approval first.

- Identify the existing MTR facilities at or within construction site, such as manhole cover, OHL portal. Carry out the condition survey and photographic record to locate the UU before any excavation works. Permit to dig system will be implemented to ensure protection system to the existing UU before commencement of works. The method statement will be submitted separately.

- If condition survey found MTR existing equipment/material, we will fence off the existing MTR stuff first and have protection. After condition survey, we will give the results to depot and liaise about the existing MTR stuff.

- All workers should possess the qualification Railway Safety training (RSI), and can only smoke at the smoking area that demarcated by CSHK.

- Prior to commence the works, CSHK will provide the information to MTR CWBU Inspector, in order to submit the work notice to SOC/DCC every Friday.

For Crane Lorry and Lifting Gear

- All plants and equipment will be inspected prior to the mobilization on site to ensure that they are in good working condition and comply with the current regulations., all statutory forms/certificates of Lifting Appliances (LA) and Lifting Gear (LG) must be valid 

- If they are in good working condition, CSHK will arrange the plants mobilization to site

- Before operation of the plant, CSHK will arrange a plant inspection with MTR CWBU inspector.

- If they are in good working condition, CSHK will submit the permit to lift (for crane lorry,grab lorry lifting gear) and plant permit (for backhoe).

- The Safe Working Load (SWL) is required to be shown on lifting appliance or to lifting gear.

- All lifting work is to be in accordance with the F&IU (lifting appliance and lifting gear regulations)

Lunch Arrangement for CSHK workers 

If number of workers less than 10 people, worker can have their lunch at depot canteen after 12:30pm, if number of workers more than 10 people, worker will go out the site for lunch or arrange meal box to them.
