Prior to the commencement of piling works, station/depot structures and the new track bifurcation Works, a 4.5m or 7m high Railway Protection (RP) fence shall be installed to protect the existing railway infrastructure from the adjacent construction Works.

This method statement describes the general method and sequence of site clearance and RP fence installation at Works Area W2 within the depot area, located between the mainline and test trac,from GLA1 to GL120 as shown in Figure 1.1. The method statement for the site clearance and RP fence installation at OYB south shall be submitted separately.

Figure 1.1 Location Plan for RP Fence at W2 located between the Mainline and Test Track

Supplementary method statements shall be submitted separately to tackle any condition encountered on site that requires a specific RP fence detail to be developed. The detailed protection fence setting out plan or installation details will be provided under separate submission. As the works will be carried in the Operation Areas, EDOCs will be required to be submitted. The lifting plan and protection measures to the existing OA equipment/utilities shall be submitted separately after detailed site inspections and surveys have been completed.

All UU diversions along the mainline and test track as show Figure 1.2 below (such as signalling equipment, cable trough, cable draw pit, etc..) shall be completed by the designated contractors before commencement of the site clearance and RP fence installation. UU detection will be conducted after site clearance to verify if any uncharted UU is found. The method statement for UU detection is under separate submission.

Between GL100 to GL120; all area is flat area.

Figure 8.1-2 Existing Ground Condition at W2

As the working area is 10.7m wide, including 2.7m width for the RP footing and sheet/PBSH pile installation, a temporary platform is required to be constructed to provide a level surface to carry out the works.

At locations with flat ground

Referring to the existing site condition, from GL 1A to GL 45, granular sub-base will be used to fill and level up the existing ground condition and shall be well compacted. The ground surface will be compacted by the vibratory roller with repeated passes, the actual passes subject to the weight of roller and thickness of subbase. The maximum depth of the filling materials is 150mm.

Step 1- Install barrier

Waterfilled barriers will be installed along the test track (2.8m distance from the centre of track) with orange net securely fixed to the existing cable brackets along the mainline side in order to confine the workfront as shown in Figure 8.1-3. After enclosing the works area with water filled barriers and orange net, the workfront area will be declared as a CA Area. Subsequent work can then be carried out during TH, except for passing or lifting over the test track which can only be undertaken during NPH.

Step 2-Remove Vegetation

A 3 or 5-ton excavator, to suit availability, will be delivered to the works areas via the access gates and across the test track. To allow the excavator to cross the test track a prefabricated temporary platform will be built to deck over the track when the temporary level crossings are not available. The temporary platform will be removed after the excavator has crossed over the test track. The platform (Figure 8.1-4) will be installed and removed during the same shift and will be designed to allow for lightweight components that can be installed using either the 3 or 5 ton excavator or a mobile crane located on the South Road. Site clearance and ground levelling will be carried out with the assistance of the excavator. In general, granular sub-base will be used for ground levelling. The sub-base, if required, will be delivered to the works area by 5.5 ton dump trucks via the level crossing or steel platform (if the level crossing has not been installed).

Figure 8.1-4 Temporary Platform for Backhoe Access Over the Test Track (will be built and 

removed during the same shift)

The existing RP fence will be temporarily removed locally to allow the excavator to cross the test track and reinstated immediately after the works. The connection details to allow temporary removal of the existing RP fence are shown in Figure 8.1-5, the location for temporary removal of existing fence are shown in Appendix C.

Figure 8.1-5 Temporary Connection Details for Existing RP Fence

Garbage removal or material delivery will be by manual delivery or rail mounted wagon/engineering train (subject to advance booking and availability) at the initial stage when the BUGN for material lifting over the test track is pending approval. For the manual removal and delivery, access to the works areas will be via the existing emergency gates 4 (EAG4) & 5 (EAG5) during NPH/TH.

At locations with sloping ground - Form the working platform for RP Fence and piling works at TH/NPH

From GL 45 to GL 100 the mainline and test track are at different levels and are separated by an existing slope. A working platform shall be formed to provide a level surface for RP fence installation and piling works. The platform will be formed by concrete blocks and filled with compacted granular fill or light weight concrete. The design of the working platform will be submitted separately. The construction sequence is shown below in Figure 8.1.6 with detailed sections at GL20,40,60,80,100shown in Figure 8.1-7 to 8.1-11.

After completion, the platform shall be checked by the TWC and a Permit to Load issued before use.

## 8.3 RP fencing installation

Upon completion of the site clearance and working platform, the RP fence installation will commence. The early stages of RP fence installation (Jun 2024 to Dec 2025) will be divided into two stages. The details of the RP fence setting out are shown Appendix C. The sequence of work will be as follows:

Stage 1 of RP Fence

Fencing installation will start from GL 20 to GL 120 from June 2024 to Sept 2024 (when the west test track is still in use) and existing gates 4 (EAG4) & 5 (EAG5) will be maintained. Workers will access the works areas via the test track during NPH subject to depot approval. From GL 1A to GL 20, the clearance between the OHL masts of the test track and mainline is constrained such that the potential risk of OHL wire damage or contact during lifting is considered too high. It is proposed to install the RP fence at this location adjacent to the mainline after the west test track closure August 2024.The Stage 1 Layout Plan shown in Figure 8.3-1 refers.

<!-- Figure 8.3-1 Stage 1 RP Fence Layout Plan  -->

After the west test track has closed, the RP Fence for GL1A GL20 as shown in the Layout Plan in Figure 8.3-2 will be installed. The existing access gates EAG4 and EAG5 will be relocated to the 1701 7m high RP fence at the same chainage before removal of the existing test track RP fence. Waterfilled barriers shall be installed to establish the construction area before removal of the existing fence. The existing door of EAG4 and EAG5 will be re-used and relocated within the installed RP fence during the same shift.

## 8.4 RP Fence Construction Arrangement and Sequence

Construction works will be carried out in close proximity to the existing test track and AEL/TCL mainline which require robust railway protection measures to be in place before commencement of any physical site works. Referring to (Library) Working Paper No.6 & the approved BUGN – Railway Protection (pending), a minimum 4.5 m high fence is proposed for activities that do not require plant/machinery with high boom or where there are no overhead line (OHL) masts on that particular side of the track. A minimum 7 m high fence is proposed for activities which require the use of plant/machinery with high booms adjacent to the fence, or where the OHL masts are located on that side of the track. The minimum clearance between fence mesh and the OHL fault return wire is required to be at least 850 mm as shown in Figure 8.4-1.

Figure 8.4-1 minimum clearance between fence mesh and the OHL

The closest part of the fence structure is required to have sufficient clearance to the structural gauge which is a minimum of 2615 mm measured from rail centreline for the depot track and 2995 mm for the mainline track as shown in Figure 8.4-2.

Fencing installation trial for workers

As the installation of the RP Fence requires NTH/NPH as well as working in close proximity to the existing railway lines, to ensure no potential incident / accident / damage / disruption to the railway a ‘mock-up’ will be set up at the outside storage yard to simulate the site condition of the OHL mast and fault return wire. Foreman, workers and plant operators will be able to carry out a trial installation of the RP fence in a non-railway environment. The aim of this arrangement is to allow the foremen and workers to familiarise themselves with the sequence, methods and risks associated with the installation works off-line from the railway. Through this trial, all workers/staff involved with the operation will be properly trained and conversant with a safe system of work before accessing and carrying out installation works on the railway.

In order to provide the safe working condition for RP Fence installation, we will carry out weather condition check prior to start the work. 

• wind speed less than 40 km/h 

###### • Call off if adverse Weather occur or within 2 hours

• Stop construction work when thunderstorms occur

RP Fence Construction Time

RP Fence installation along the mainline will be carried out during NTH, tentatively 2:00 to 4:00 am on Fri-Sat, Sat-Sun and one other night during the week. RP Fence installation along test track will be carried out during NPH, tentatively 11:00 am to 03:00 pm. 

<!-- NPH NTH  -->

###### A pre-work briefing and mobilisation of equipment and materials will be carried out in advance of track access. Once track possession has been granted by the TC, the OHL de-energised and flashing lamps installed, fencing installation work will commence. Before the end of each shift, all completed fence installation works shall be checked by the MTR inspector and CSHK’s TWC to ensure the installation is in accordance with the working drawings and stable before leaving the site. In addition, the fence shall be earthed at the end of each shift and checked by a suitably qualified REW. The table below shows the detailed working schedule.

Steps for RP Fence installation:

### 1. During TH, set out the RP Fence location.

### 2. During NTH, lift the RP Fence footing to the right position along the mainline.

### 3. During NTH, lift and install the RP Fence frame to the footing and connect the earthing system.

4. During NPH, lift the RP Fence footing to the right position along the test track.

5. During NPH, lift and install the RP Fence frame to the footing and connect the earthing system.
