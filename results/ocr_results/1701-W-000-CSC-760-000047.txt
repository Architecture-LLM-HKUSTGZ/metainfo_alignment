## 6.2 Topography Survey

Topography Survey along SSK Drive for the Feasibility Study on Temporary Widening will be carried out along the SSK Drive (approx. 870m) with the planned extent shown in Appendix A. In which, the as-built road profile, existing ground level, location of existing features shall be recorded by survey team. The information will be used to determine the extent of temporary widening of SSK Drive.

For the plotting scale 1:500. A quick check of survey instruments before the field work will be carried out. At the starting and end of the topography survey process, two or more back-sight reference controls will be used to ensure that the control stations and entire survey process are stable and trustworthy.

The topography survey plan should record all original landforms, topography, levels and etc., it also locates or confirms the details and locations of all utility services, carriageway, roadsides furniture, buildings, structures and any construction work adjacent to the site.

Survey control stations for topography survey shall be established by traverse and comply with standard of accuracy as required in General Specification.

Clear field notes are required and on-site verification will be carried out to ensure coverage and correctness, it will be assisted by field booking with feature code with reference to CADD Manual, and the drawing sketches on site. All data will be recorded in data logger.

## Safety

(a) Coordination between CEDD Contract Contract No. NL/2020/07 will be arranged prior to arrangement of Topography Survey, including but not limited to the extent of survey work and working period.

(b) All workers shall be equipped with reflective vests and safety helmets during operation.

All workers must go through a briefing by the Construction Manager / Engineer / Safety Officer / Safety Supervisor before commencement of any works.

## ( 3 Mtr

Contract 1701 - Oyster Bay Station and Associated Works
(c)  A pre-meeting will be arranged before commencement of the work among Survey Team, Construction Team and Safety Team to brief the nature of works, the safety aspects and the necessary safety requirements as identified in the Risk Assessment in Appendix D.

(d) Safety helmets fitted with chin straps must be worn within the site, safety boots, hearing protectors (if needed), high visibility jackets / sashes, reflective vests, goggles, gloves and full body harnesses for work at height will be provided to all staff working on site. Plastic barriers and reflective traffic cones will be prepared prior to work commencement to demarcate the working area.

(e) Particular care needs to be taken when working on or near SSK Drive. Plastic barriers and reflective traffic cones will be prepared prior to work commencement to demarcate the working area.

(f)   Any emergency situation shall be reported to site supervisors (i.e. Construction Manager/
Engineer/ Foreman, etc.) and Safety Department for prompt response. The emergency contact list is shown in Section 3.

The risk for the works shall be assessed and the Risk Assessment Analysis is shown in Appendix D.

8.

## Environmental

| The following mitigation measures will be followed:   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|

## (A) Noise

General works shall be carried out during normal working hours (08:00 to 18:00). However, should the progress demand for the works to be undertaken from 19:00 to 07:00 next day or on public holidays, construction noise permit shall be obtained as necessary.

## (B) Trees

The risk of causing damage to existing trees during survey works is low. If any survey will affect the existing tree, construction team will be informed immediately for resolving.

9.

## Quality Control

Refer to Appendix B for Inspection and Test Plan.

Construction works shall be fully complied with Quality Plan.

o For work activity which is classified as "Quality Hold Point", no subsequent work can be started unless the former work activity was inspected and accepted by MTR's inspectorate.
