**When Work Area within Depot, CSHK would submit the NTH/NPH (SPA/PA) and AP(E) application with programme to MTR via ETMS accordingly. ** 

**4 Worker Verification ** 

**• All workers will be picked up at designated area such as Tung Chung Station.** 

**• During boarding the shuttle bus, hand-held facial recognition will be performed to verify the**  **worker's qualification. ** 

**• The facial recognition system will check if the person has passed the RSI and possesses a green card. ** 

**• List of workers shall be submitted for MTR for registration before starting of works, the list shall be updated weekly and available for MTR as requested. ** 

**Uniform and Safety Equipment: All workers shall wear PPE and the standard uniform and safety helmet for easy recognition by security guards and DYM. ** 

**5 Preparation Works ** 

**Before commencement of the installation, the following works shall be completed** 

**5.1 General ** 

**5.1.2 Identify all existing MTR’s facilities/ equipment/ materials (e.g. pipeline, ducting and trough) at or within installation area during the site condition survey. After that, the identified existing MTR’s facilities/ equipment/ materials will be fenced off/ protected/ isolated/ relocated/ diverted before start the construction works. ** 

**5.1.3 Site clearance will be carried out after the proposed installation locations confirmed. ** 

**5.2 Setting Out ** 

**5.2.1 The location of each monitoring point will be set out at the co-ordinates shown on the Construction Drawings or as agreed with MTR’s representative on site. ** 

**5.2.2 Once the location has been set out a joint inspection will be held with MTR’s representative on site and other stakeholders such as Utility Company or the land owner’s/ occupier’s representatives to agree the location prior to further execution. At locations where the proposed monitoring point is unlikely to or dangerous to access for either installation or later monitoring works, relocation shall be considered. Alternatively, safe access to the location will be constructed. ** 

**5.2.3 Referring to the railway safety requirements and construction drawings, if the proposed monitoring point is close to the OHL mast/ track, CSHK will further verify the site condition with the MTR representative onsite to ensure that the proposed location meets the minimum safety distance and take relative precautions, such as de-energize, isolation, or relocation. **

**7 Installation Details ** 

**The following are the installation sequence and method for different type I&M installation ** 

**7.1 Ground Settlement Marker (GS) ** 

**7.1.1 Fence off the works area before commencing the works by plastic**  **barriers. ** 

**7.1.2 Deliver the ground settlement markers (A 12mm dia. mild steel rod with 250mm SQ. x 4mm THK steel plate) on site. ** 

**7.1.3 Place the ground settlement marker into hand excavated 300mm SQ. x 800mm(H) hole. ** 

**7.1.4 Install Dia. 25mm PVC sleeve on the ground settlement marker and leaving the rod protruding approximately 100mm above the PVC sleeve**  **top. ** 

**7.1.5 Backfill the excavated pit with granular backfill with well compacted ** 

**7.1.6 Temporary cover plate will be provided should any incomplete holes be**  **left unattended. ** 

**7.1.7 Construct the precast concrete box with hinged steel cover. The concrete box size is 300 SQ. x 200mm (H) with 75mm wall thk. And then**  **remove the waterfilled barrier. ** 

**7.1.8 The plastic barriers will be removed after installation completed.** 

**7.1.9 If the GS construction works cannot complete in one day, the waterfilled barriers/ fencing for physical separation and additional warning lights are required where necessary. ** 

**7.1.10 If the proposed GS located near/ at pavement, the pin details will be adopted. **
