<td colspan="1" rowspan="2"> There are two existing cable bridges across southern road at upper ground level position. With the development of site works, the capacity of southern road will tend to achieve its maximum value. In fact, various kinds of vehicle to serve different party and purpose (i.e. internal transportation and piling work) will pass thought southern road. It is necessary to set up height limitation and draw attention to every south road user no tolerance is allowed. Therefore, we would like to propose a 4.5m clearance height gauge for cable bridge protection. We consider to set-up height gauge with reference to location plan below.

**Crane lorry is guided by a traffic controller to park at a designated location near temporary storage area. Workers then help set-up crane lorry and fence-off works area for unloading work on bed. It should be aware that stacks of height gauge components should not exceed 1m high level measured from ground level.** 

**CP(T) is assigned to carry out registration in main gate of SHW depot and take crane lorry to designated location for unloading and set-up fatal zone. Meanwhile, It is forbidden to pass through west leveling crossing without leading by CP(T). A CP(T) is enforced and required to lead and ahead of vehicle with goods on bed when going to southern road by west levelling crossing during unloading goods and departure of SHW depot**

**Pre-work Notification** 

**Prior to the height-gauge set-up (material transportation and on-site assembly work), site pictures taking is necessary to be carried out for several reasons.** 

**1. Environment investigation can identify potential dangers of work area in which risk assessment will be more accurate;** 

**2. Protection of existing equipment and facility to avoid any damage during assembly work and component unloading;** 

## 3. Ground condition is able to reflect by pictures and decide whether surface treatment is required or not before work. 

<!-- Site Picture  Proposed location of new height  gauge set-up The definition of overall clearance (4.5m maximum) is linear measurement from top   -->

**The definition of overall clearance (4.5m maximum) is linear measurement from top of road level to**  **underneath of Height-gauge. Since the road level is not uniform, our site survey team will counter-check**  **random points we pick on road level and give out raw value of headroom level which does not allow to**  **exceed 4.5m in maximum.** 

**10.**  **Safety (Risk Assessments)** 

**Risk Assessment attached in Appendix A has been prepared for all general activities. Specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow. A PIC (person-in-charge) together with the RSO, will supervise overall erection works which is complied with construction sequence and guarantee works are taken part in safe and amicable working environment.**
