2. The structural condition survey shall be carried out to all structural elements of the building and civil engineering structures and retaining structures within the specified structures such as beams, slabs, columns, internal walls, external walls, base slabs, joints, structures and compounds above ground. 

**7.2 Visual Inspection ** 

1. Visual inspection by systematic visual structural checking and recording will be carried out with the aid of measuring tapes, cameras, torches, binoculars, thickness measuring devices to all the above-mentioned structural elements of every specified structure, so that the general conditions of all these structural elements can be assessed and recorded. 

2. A standard survey sheet shall be devised to record any structural defects observed during the inspection, such as cracking, spalling, bulging, leakage, deterioration, corrosion / rust, settlement, etc. and to produce the defects record. Location and extent of the defects shall also be recorded. A sample standard survey sheet is attached for reference. 

3. The terms used in describing defects shall be defined as follows (but not limited to):
