9. After the filler has set, a PVC pipe cutter shall be used to cut the duct .Once cutting is completed,the duct shall be removed carefully .With reference to **Diagram D** , there is sufficient clearance of 50mm to ensure safe conduct during cutting work. Nevertheless, extra car eshal lbe taken to ensure no contact with any part of the cable.

10 .Prior to slewing wor kof 11kV electrical supply cable and HV equipment signal cables by hand, the power of 11kV cable must be shut off. Application to cut power and isolation of the cable shall be submitted to depot authority .Power outage time shall follow as stated under Programme and Working Hours – from 0200 to 0400 hour s(refer to **Appendix**  **D** for detailed work schedule). 

11 .When all necessary approvals and permits have been obtained from depot authority, the power supply in AB16 shall be shut off and LO/TO system shall be applied.

12 .The HV equipment signal cables shall be slewed away by hand following **Diagram C** . 

13. The signal cables shall be enclosed using a split PVC duct tied with metal wire (refer to **Diagram**  **D** ).

**Diagram E** 

**Diagram F** 

14. Before commencement of 11kV cable slewing by hand, a qualified electrician will conduct a final check to ensure there is no electrical supply through the cable. Once confirmed, the cable shall be slewed away following **Diagram G** .

15. The 11kV cable shall be enclosed using a split PVC duct tied with metal wire after slewing is completed. 

16 .Power supply shall be switched on and doors of AB16 shall be locked.

17 .Cable protectio nwarning tape shall be placed in parallel at 500mm abov ethe slewed cable ducts whe nbackfilling with sand (refer to **Diagram H** ).
