The route and the type of transportation used shall be pre-determined to make sure it meets the site requirements and limitations. On top of that, firm and flat ground shall be provided to ensure it can sustain the loading of the said crane. Otherwise, adequate steel plate or shall be placed on the ground for the assembly/disassembly work areas if necessary.7.2 Logistics Arrangement: Plant, labour and material7.2.1 Scope of this method statementThe scope of this method statement covers the following activities:a. Site preparation for the delivery of crane body and partsb. Delivery of the crawler crane parts from the West gate and East gate to the W11 site area.c. Assembly & disassembly of crawler crane in the W11 site area.d. To set up the necessary protection, barricades such as water-filled barriers and other auxiliary worksrelated to the assembly and disassembly of the crawler cranes.7.2.2 Working AreaThe works areas which are fully enclosed by fencing or water-filled barriers and declared as Construction Areas (CAs), RSI training and EDOC are not required for labour working in these areas.

### 7.2.3 General Access and Crawler Crane Delivery Path to W11

The delivery of crawler crane parts is proposed to pass through the vehicular access bridge, we would also temporarily utilize the west gate (or east gate) via the west level crossing to deliver the crawler crane parts of height less than 4m (e.g up to 80-ton crawler crane). Approval from depot will be granted for transporting crawler crane parts between 4 to 4.2m. During delivery from the West gate, an escort vehicle with CPs would be deployed to escort the delivery vehicles. CP(T) would be stationed at the West Gate to check the vehicular

height, direct the traffic and communicate with the yardmaster continuously. Apart from the construction vehicles, a shuttle escorted by an escort vehicle would be arranged to directly carry the worker from the West Gate to the Container Village at W11 via the West level crossing.

We would also utilize the East gate with similar safety procedure same as West Gate would be deployed. The necessary permits/forms adhered to the main contractor or MTRC will be filled up before the access of the machinery. Machinery inspection shall be carried out by the safety personnel and relevant party. Nonetheless, we would hold regular workshops with RP/Yardmaster to go through current works within all CAs in order to identify and review any impact upon railway and/or depot operation. The rules and procedures for Railway Protection under the Railway Ordinance will be in accordance with Practice Note for Authorized Persons, Registered Structural Engineers and Registered Geotechnical Engineers (PNAP ADV-33 / APP-24) and MTRCL working paper No.6-Railway Protection-Revision B-December 2022.

The details of general logistics should refer to the submitted security and traffic management plan.

### 7.2.4 Preparation for the Crawler Crane Transport

Since there is site limit for the height and road width clearance, all the crawler crane parts such as crane body, jib boom, counterweight, sliding shoes and associated lifting gear will be loaded on the low bed, trailer and flatbed which the total height with the parts shall be within the site height clearance of 4.5m. If the measured total height is more than 4m, “Permit to move” is required with the YM approval.

The following items will be checked by the crane provider before loading it to the load loader:

a. To secure the base crane on the trailer

b. Using the chain block or steel chain to wrap all parts of crawler crane

c. Tighten the chain block or steel chain to secure the machine on the trailer

d. Lower down the boom base to the rigid supporting and keep the wire in tension

e. Slewing lock pin is fixed

f. Swing brake is engaged

g. All levers in the neutral position

h. The base machine is at horizontal

## i. Make sure no obstacles lying on the ground from the path of the trailer

## j. All workers should stay outside the fatal zone of the crawler crane

k. After all loading material’s height on the low bed, trailer & flatbed shall not be over 4.5

#### 7.2.7.2 Carbody Weight and Crawler shoes installation by helping crane

(CP) and operator to make sure it is safe to perform the next step.

• Swing brake is engaged.

• Workers must wear safety harnesses hooked on designated area.

• 2 units of mounting rope are in working condition.

• No obstacles on the counterweight mounting frame
