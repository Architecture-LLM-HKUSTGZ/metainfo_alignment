**Work Sequence** 

1. The position of **initia**  **l** rail cutting is set at 4.41m westward from chainage CH377.54 (Signal Faulting Point) of Under Frame Wash Facility trac kat gridline GL 100. The position shall be marked by spray painting on rail.

Any hard copies seen are uncontrolled unless chopped with a red control stam p Page 5 of 14

## 2. The initial rail cutting position shall be fenced off with plasti cbarriers following the layout below.The placement of plastic barriers shall not be positioned beyond the signal fouling point.

**Fencing Layout Plan** 

**Section A** 

3 .Before commencement of rail cutting work, hot work permit shall be applied and obtained from depot management. Rail cutting area shall be prepared with all necessary hot work safety facilities following MTR guidelines, and a fire marshal shall be on standby.

4 .The rail saw cutter shall be clamped onto the rail to ensure stability and to provide a linear cut.

5.Once clamp is secured, rail cutting shall commence. Water shall be sprayed periodically on grass area at both sides of track during rail cutting work to prevent ignition of dry grass fire.

## 6.After initial rail cutting has been completed, the plastic barriers shall be arranged following the layout below and filled with water to enclose the subsequent working zone for cutting and removal of remaining Under Frame Wash Facility track. The arrangement of water-filled barriers shall not obstruct the level crossing.

**Cutting and Removal of Remaining Under Frame Wash Facility Track Plan** 

8. When entire length of remaining track has been divided into 12m segments, the rail clips shall be removed from the rail shoulde rby using a panpuller. 

<!--    -->

9 .With the rail clips removed,  acrane lorry shall be utilised to lift and remov eall 12 mrail segment soffsite for disposal .The maximum lifting radius involved is 18m. According to the load chart, the safe working load at 18m is 3 tons. Each rail segment shall have an approximate weight of 0.7 tons.

10 .Once entire track has been removed, area W11E shall be fenced off and established as a Construction Area (CA).
