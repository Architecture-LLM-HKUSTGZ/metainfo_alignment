### 8.3.3 .Ceiling installation 

After the new steel frame is installed, the new proprietary system roof cladding will be fixed to the column on the top by using self-drilling screw **Figure 8.3.5** . 

**Figure 8.3.5 self-drilling screw** 

### 8.3.4. Existing Charging piles Modification 

closure the diesel generator in work area W7 to ensure that the charging pile is not powered during the relocation. 

Relocation of existing charging piles to newly constructed parking spaces .This work will take one day, during which time the charging function in the works area W7 parking space will be unavailable until the charging piles are installed in the new parking space.

13 .Under normal circumstances, live work is strictly prohibited. If live work is really necessary, it must be operated by qualified electricians, and at least two people must be present at the same time, ensuring that one person operates and at least one person supervises. 

15 .Plain eye bolts only apply to vertical lifting. The angle of lifting of shoulder eye bolts should not be less than 45˚. Washers may be used to ensure that the shoulder eye bolt is firmly in contact with the surface. Never use a sling through a pair of eye bolts.

## 16 .Lorry Crane Operations

 Operate the lorry crane only on a firm and level ground.

 Before lifting, fully extend outriggers and ensure their stability on level ground.

 Never carry a load exceeding the Safe Working Load as specified by the manufacturer.

 Never abruptly swing or stop the crane.

 Never drag the loads on the ground.
