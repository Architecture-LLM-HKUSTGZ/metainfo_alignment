7.2.2 Inside LV Switch room / Canteen:

。 "Trade King 730" Aluminium scaffold tower will be used. Attached herewith thecatalogue,drawings, certificate and instruction manual for your review. Catalogue, installation manual refer to Appendix H.

7.3 Formation of Flooring Opening (Using Coring Machine)

"Permit to drill/core" shall be implemented before using coring machine.

(Blanked form refer to Appendix J)

Before any drilling works, cover meter/wall scanner will be applied to confirm the absence of concealed or cast-in conduits or items inside the slab or wall before drilling. Please refer to the guideline and general procedure listed below for applying Cover Meter/Wall Scanner:

1. Ensure the device is properly calibrated and the user is familiar with the device.

2. Set out the drilling point; and mark the scanning area (around 400 x 400mm from the boundary of the drilling point)

3.Clear the drilling area of any obstructions and debris. Ensure that the surface is clean and accessible for the cover meter to make accurate measurements.

4.Select the suitable type according to the wall type or slab to be inspected.

Details can refer to the user manual as attached.
