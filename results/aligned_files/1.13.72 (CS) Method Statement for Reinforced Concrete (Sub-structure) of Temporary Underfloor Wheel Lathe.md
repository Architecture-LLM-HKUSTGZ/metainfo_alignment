## 7. Construction Methods / Construction Sequence

### 7.1 Construction Sequence

#### Step 1: Waterproofing Installation

The external formwork and waterproofing layer will be carried out at the bottom of the layer which is shown in the following diagram. The installation details of the waterproofing material can be referred to ACC reference 1701-W-000-CSC-775-000194.

#### Step 2: Formwork erection and placing concreting works on the base slab

The first formwork erection will be erected for the base slab as shown in Figure 7.1.2. Rebar Fixing and concreting works will be carried out.

#### Step 3: Backfill (C20/20) Mass Concrete Fill

Removal of the base slab formwork. Lifting the 3-ton excavator for carrying out the site formation works. Removal of the 3-ton excavator after completion of site formation works. Backfill with C20/20 mass concrete for a 1000mm gap along 4 sides of the structure.

#### Step 4: Removal of Steel Struts at +3.200mPD

Once the mass concrete strength reached 20MPa, the 2nd layer of strut at +3.200mPD can be removed and lifted to the storage area. Flame-cutting machine will be used to separate the steel materials part by part before lifting. The steel materials will be lifted part by part.

#### Step 5: Erection of Formworks and Waterproof layer for walls

Erection of the access tower before carrying out the formwork erection works. The external formwork and waterproofing layer will be carried out for the additional walls which is shown in the following diagram. The installation details of the waterproofing material can be referred to ACC reference 1701-W-000-CSC-775-000194.

#### Step 6: Formwork erection and placing concreting works for slab and wall

The falsework and inner formwork erection will be erected for the slab at +6mPD and walls as shown in Figure 7.1.6, which is reference to the approved formwork design and drawings. Holding down bolts of the columns of the steel structures will be installed before concreting works. Rebar Fixing and concreting works will be carried out.

#### Step 7: Formwork and falseworks removal

After the concrete cube test is passed, the formworks and falseworks of the columns, walls and slab can be removed. Most of the materials will be removed by crawler cranes.

#### Step 8: Backfilling of the 1000mm gap

Relocation of the access tower to the inner area of TUFWL. An excavator will be lifted to the gap to assist the backfilling works with sand materials.

#### Step 9: Mass concrete Placing

Place the mass concrete as per Figure 7.1.9 below.

#### Step 10: Erection of staircase

Erection of falseworks and formwork for the internal staircase. Rebar fixing works will be carried out accordingly. After inspection, the concrete placing works will be carried out. After the concrete cube test passed, remove the falseworks and formwork of the staircase.

#### Step 11: Removal of waling and strut

After receiving the certificate, the 1st layer of strut at +6.850mPD can be removed and lifted to the storage area. Flame-cutting machine will be used to separate the steel materials part by part before lifting. The steel materials will be lifted part by part.

## 8. Safety (Risk Assessments)

1. **Work in Operation Areas**: For workers on site in Operation Areas within a 10m zone adjacent to the OHL post or trackwork, those workers shall obtain RSI before works and be supervised by CP(T). If the working area is within the Construction Area, only supervision by WPIC and CP(T) or CP(NT) is required.
2. **Site-Specific Induction**: All workers shall attend a site-specific induction course conducted by the Safety Department. The Safety Officer shall explain the necessary safety requirements, and the Site Agent/Foreman/Engineer in charge of the work shall explain the system of work to his supervisors and workers.
3. **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**: All workers shall be equipped with reflective vests and safety helmets during operation. All workers must go through a briefing by the Site Agent/Safety Officer/Safety Supervisor before the commencement of any works. All workers on site shall obtain an approved "Mandatory Basic Safety Training Certificate".
4. **Pre-Meeting**: A pre-meeting will be arranged before the commencement of the work among Foreman/Site Agent, MTR's representatives, and the Safety Department to brief the nature of works, the safety aspects, and the requirements laid down in the Safety Plan. Besides, Temporary Works Management Plan, Hot Work Permit, and Permit to Load will be introduced and implemented in this construction work.
5. **PPE Usage**: Safety helmets fitted with chin straps must be worn within the site, safety boots, hearing protectors (if needed), high visibility jackets/sashes, reflective vests, goggles, gloves, and full-body harnesses for work at height will be provided to all staff working on site. Warning signs and barriers will be erected where necessary.
6. **Emergency Situations**: Any emergency situation shall be reported to CSHK's site supervisors (i.e., Site Agent/Foreman/Engineer, etc.) and the Safety Department for prompt response. The emergency contact list is shown in Appendix C.

The risk for the works shall be assessed, and the Risk Assessment Analysis is shown in Appendix A.

## 9. Environmental (Environmental Aspect & Impact Identification as well as Mitigation Measures)

1. **Working Hours**: Works should be carried out during 07:00 to 19:00 on normal working days. No PME will be used after 19:00 on normal working days, Sundays, and public holidays unless a valid construction noise permit is obtained.
2. **Diesel Usage**: ULSD diesel will be used in all PME.
3. **QPME Label**: Plant with QPME label will be employed, if available.
4. **Chemical Handling**: All chemicals will be placed on a drip tray.
5. **Dust Control**: For excavated materials, water spray will be carried out during the work to prevent dust generation.
6. **NRMM Compliance**: Only regulated NRMM with approved NRMM label to be used on site.
7. **Wastewater Management**: Wastewater will discharge to the designated discharge point via the wester.
8. **Environmental Permit Compliance**: The works shall follow relevant mitigation measures as required under the Environmental Permit (EP) / EP submissions and Contractor's Environmental Management Plan (EMP).
9. **Dusty Materials**: Stockpiles of dusty materials, including excavated material, will be properly covered by tarpaulin or other accepted means to prevent airborne dust impact.

## 10. Quality Control (Inspection and Test Plan including Hold Points)

Refer to Appendix B for the Inspection and Test Plan.

To ensure the attainment of the required standard of works, the methods of working and the required work standards/acceptance criteria are defined in the method statement, inspection & test plans, and are communicated to relevant staff and workers carrying out the works. Day-to-day routine inspections of the works will be carried out by the Construction Team Leader, Site Engineers, and Foreman as appropriate, to ensure that all works are performed following the requirements of these documents.

Specific quality checks shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Inspection & Test Plan with "Hold Points" at critical elements for confirmation of compliance before proceeding further. Request for Inspection and Survey Check (RISC) shall be issued to the MTR Inspection Team following inspection of the works by the CSHK's project team. The Inspection & Test Plan for the works (Appendix B) will identify all Hold Points and Witness Points.

Following the Inspection & Test carried out, inspection and/or test records are to be prepared to indicate whether the specified requirements have been met. Records of Inspection and testing will be maintained and kept available for inspection and final handover as appropriate.
