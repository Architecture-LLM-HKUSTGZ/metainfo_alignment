### 4.2 Reason

For the future Oyster Bay Station (South) and associated works construction, foundation and superstructure works are to be carried out. To facilitate the construction works for the foundation works in W2 (area between Test Track and mainline) and in W11 (area between North and South Roads), temporary water supply, power supply and temporary drainage system shall be set up and provided for construction works. The temporary services shall be passed through existing tracks including West Depot Entry Track (WDET) and Test Track (TT) to the construction areas. Cross track ducts (as pipe sleeve) shall be installed underneath the existing track for the installation of temporary services.

### 4.3 Description

1701 Contractor will carry out the installation of cross track ducting at West Depot Entry Track and Test Track respectively as per correlated latest approved method statement for temporary water supply with cross track duct under ACC Ref No. 1701-W-000-CSC-760-000132.

Precaution measures for various potential risks/situation have been reviewed and summarized in the hazard log referring to Appendix B.

#### B. Working Time

- Mainline: 3 nos of NTH per week (2:00am to 4:00am)
- Test Track: 3 night time (Friday^Saturday, Saturday^Sunday and one on weekday) per week or NPH subject to Depot Schedule
- Depot track: NTH (2:00am to 4:00am)/ NPH (11:00am to 3:00pm) daily

#### C. Preparation Work

There are one group of 2 nos. cross track ducts proposed to be installed at the WDET (see Figure 1) and there are 3 groups of 6 nos. of cross track ducts proposed to be installed near the proposed level crossing at TT (Nearby gate TT06, TT07 & TT0A) (see Figures 2 & 3).

##### C.1 Setting Out

The location of cross track duct will be set out as per Construction Drawings or as agreed with MTR’s representatives on site.

Once the location has been set out a joint inspection will be held with MTR’s representatives on site and other stakeholders or the land owner’s/ occupier’s representatives to agree the location prior to further execution. At locations where the proposed cross track duct is unlikely to or dangerous to access for either installation or later monitoring works, relocation shall be considered.
