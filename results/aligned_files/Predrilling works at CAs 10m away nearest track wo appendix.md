# Predrilling works at CAs 10m away nearest track wo appendix

## 1. **Introduction**

This document provides an overview of the method statement for predrilling of foundation works for the area which is 10m away from the track and OHL where EDOC is not required according to the latest BUGN2023/21 (Issue/Rev:1.0). The predrilling works will be commenced after the works areas declared as construction areas (CAs). The method statement covers first the access to the designated works area and the procedure related to predrilling with details of sub-contractor attached. It details the responsible personnel including managers, engineers and workers for executing the construction activities. Furthermore, it included the plant and equipment to be adopted and detailed set up on site. Lastly, it includes the safety and environment and quality control requirement to ensure the construction is safe and robust. Relevant drawings, job hazard analysis can be found in the appendix.
