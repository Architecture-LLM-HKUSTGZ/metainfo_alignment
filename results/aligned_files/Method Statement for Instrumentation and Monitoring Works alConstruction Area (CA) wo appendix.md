- List of workers shall be submitted for MTR for registration before starting of works, the list shall be updated weekly and available for MTR as requested.

**Uniform and Safety Equipment:** All workers shall wear PPE and the standard uniform and safety helmet for easy recognition by security guards and DYM.

**Preparation Works**

Before commencement of the installation, the following works shall be completed:

**General**

5.1.2 Identify all existing MTR’s facilities/ equipment/ materials (e.g. pipeline, ducting and trough) at or within installation area during the site condition survey. After that, the identified existing MTR’s facilities/ equipment/ materials will be fenced off/ protected/ isolated/ relocated/ diverted before start the construction works.

5.1.3 Site clearance will be carried out after the proposed installation locations confirmed.

**Setting Out**

5.2.1 The location of each monitoring point will be set out at the co-ordinates shown on the Construction Drawings or as agreed with MTR’s representative on site.

5.2.2 Once the location has been set out a joint inspection will be held with MTR’s representative on site and other stakeholders such as Utility Company or the land owner’s/ occupier’s representatives to agree the location prior to further execution. At locations where the proposed monitoring point is unlikely to or dangerous to access for either installation or later monitoring works, relocation shall be considered. Alternatively, safe access to the location will be constructed.

5.2.3 Referring to the railway safety requirements and construction drawings, if the proposed monitoring point is close to the OHL mast/ track, CSHK will further verify the site condition with the MTR representative onsite to ensure that the proposed location meets the minimum safety distance and take relative precautions, such as de-energize, isolation, or relocation.

**Minimum Safety Distance for Track**

| Test Track/ Mainline | 2995mm from the center of track |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Depot Track          | 2615mm from the center of track |

**Cable Detection**

UU detection will be carried out before start of the works. For details, please refer to separate submission.

**Trial Pit**

Trial Pits will be carried out accordance with Permit-to-Dig System before start of the works. The details please refer to separate submission.

**Utility Diversion/ Abended Works**

Any utility required to diversion or abandoned will be carried out with relevant approved EDOC prior to start the instrumentation installation works.

**Temporary Drainage System Supply**

Wetsep will be set up when fencing/ waterfilled barriers once installed. Proposed locations please refer to Appendix D – Proposed Discharge Points.

**Pre-construction survey will be carried out before the commencement of the works, survey of existing MTR equipment at ground level, UU detections shall be completed. Reports to be submitted to MTR, showing the protections applying to the MTR equipment.**

## 6. Lifting Arrangement

**Lifting Procedure**

6.1.1 Check the ground conditions for the crane lorry;

6.1.2 Apply the Permit-to-Lift (e.g. Lifting Plan, 80% of Lifting Capacity checking);

6.1.3 After approved, fence off the lifting area by plastic barriers.

6.1.4 Lift the rig and equipment to works area.

**Lifting Capacity Checking Details (Sample)**

Weight of Rig: 1460kg  
Capacity of Crane Lorry: 4135 kg @ 10.05m  
80% Capacity of Crane Lorry: 3308 kg  
3308 > 1460 kg

**Rigging point of drilling rig**

Rigging Point (certified by RPE) For information only.

6.3 Except drilling rig, water tank (empty) and casing with hanger would be delivered to works area by crane lorry. The valid LALG certificates would be provided. For information only.

**Lifting Method for the Loose Materials**

Double tagline attached at the lifting objects before lifting.

**Method 1**

For rigging stabilization, the tiedown straps will be used to tie the drill casings (maximum length is 6m) with hanger together; connect the hook with anchoring point is secured (the anchoring point must be structurally sound tested and examined by a competent examiner).

**Method 2**

Prevent slipping or displacement of any loose objects or loads during lifting. Double wrap choker hitch method will be adopted.
