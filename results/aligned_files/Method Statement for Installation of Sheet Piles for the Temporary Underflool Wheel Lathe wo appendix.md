- Figure 7.1.1 on Page 14 of 47: The opening radius of the mobile crane is beyond the water filled barrier and encroached into the adjacent OA & track area. This is unacceptable. A shorter jib shall be adopted. Besides, before EDOC approved, no part of the jib of the crane shall encroached within 10m area from the adjacent OHL / live track.
  - Noted. The lifting radius is minimized in figure 7.1.1, and safety measures are in place, including the provision of water barrier along 10m area. These measures ensure that no part of the crane's jib encroaches within a 10m area from the adjacent OHL or live track before EDOC approval. 2 different lifting plan are also attached in Appendix D for reference.
- Figure 7.6.2 on page 21 of 47: Please mark up the 10m line (10m from the adjacent OHL/live track) on the plan.
  - Noted. The 10m line is marked in Figure 7.6.2 for your reference.
- Figure 7.7.3 & 7.7.4 on Page 24 of 47: The mentioned 29m distance is misleading. The closet distance between silent piling machine and the OHL Posts shall be measured from the SOP03.
  - This figure mainly responds to Rtc No.5 regarding the setup location of the silent piling machine. For the entire sheet piling installation works, the silent piling machine can handle the corner works without requiring any lifting during the installation of the corner sheet pile. Therefore, there is only one designated setup location, SOP01, which aligns with figures 7.7.3 and 7.7.4.
