## 7.7 Construction Works of Installation of Sheet Piles for Temporary Underfloor Wheel Lathe (Continued)

### Step 4: Sheet Pile Installation

1. **Positioning and Alignment:**
   - The sheet piles will be positioned and aligned according to the surveyor's markings.
   - Ensure the sheet piles are vertical and aligned correctly before driving them into the ground.

2. **Driving Sheet Piles:**
   - The silent piling machine will be used to drive the sheet piles into the ground.
   - The machine will grip the sheet pile and use hydraulic pressure to push it into the soil.
   - The process will be repeated for each sheet pile, ensuring they interlock correctly.

3. **Monitoring and Adjustments:**
   - Continuous monitoring will be carried out to ensure the sheet piles are driven to the required depth and alignment.
   - Adjustments will be made as necessary to maintain the correct position and verticality.

### Step 5: Welding and Interlocking

1. **Welding:**
   - If required, welding will be carried out to join sheet piles together for additional strength and stability.
   - All welding works will follow the safety protocols and be performed by certified welders.

2. **Interlocking:**
   - Ensure that each sheet pile interlocks with the adjacent pile to form a continuous barrier.
   - Check the interlocking mechanism to ensure there are no gaps or misalignments.

### Step 6: Final Checks and Quality Control

1. **Inspection:**
   - Conduct a thorough inspection of the installed sheet piles to ensure they meet the required specifications and standards.
   - Check for any signs of damage or defects and rectify them immediately.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Record the installation details, including the depth, alignment, and any adjustments made during the process.
   - Maintain a log of all inspections and quality control checks.

### Step 7: Site Cleanup and Demobilization

1. **Cleanup:**
   - Remove any debris, equipment, and materials from the site.
   - Ensure the site is left clean and safe for subsequent construction activities.

2. **Demobilization:**
   - Demobilize the silent piling machine and other equipment used for the installation.
   - Ensure all equipment is inspected and maintained before being transported off-site.

## 8. **Safety**

   - Ensure all personnel are aware of emergency procedures and contact numbers.

3. **Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment:**
   - Identify potential hazards associated with the sheet pile installation.
   - Conduct a risk assessment and implement control measures to mitigate risks.

4. **Emergency Procedures:**
   - Establish emergency procedures for incidents such as equipment failure, accidents, or adverse weather conditions.
   - Ensure all personnel are trained in emergency response and evacuation procedures.

## 9. **Environmental**

1. **Noise Control:**
   - Minimize noise pollution by using silent piling machines and other noise-reducing equipment.
   - Monitor noise levels and ensure they comply with local regulations.

2. **Dust Control:**
   - Implement dust control measures, such as water spraying, to reduce airborne dust during construction.
   - Ensure that dust control measures are effective and regularly maintained.

3. **Waste Management:**
   - Segregate and dispose of waste materials in accordance with local regulations.
   - Implement recycling and waste reduction practices where possible.

4. **Spill Prevention:**
   - Implement measures to prevent spills of hazardous materials, such as fuel or hydraulic fluid.
   - Ensure spill kits are available on-site and personnel are trained in spill response.

## 10. **Quality Control**

1. **Inspection and Testing:**
   - Conduct regular inspections and testing of materials and workmanship to ensure compliance with specifications.
   - Document all inspections and test results.

2. **Non-Conformance Management:**
   - Identify and document any non-conformances.
   - Implement corrective actions to address non-conformances and prevent recurrence.

3. **Continuous Improvement:**
