## 1. Introduction (Overview of the operation/works)
This method statement gives a guideline for the measurement of an existing LV switchboard for the installation of 2 nos. fused switch located in Switch Room "8.27‚Äù at G/F. After the measurement, the proper size of busbar will be fabricated for addition fused switch. The detailed procedures of survey, safety measures will be described to ensure the measurement is carried out in a proper and safe way with good quality and to meet the project programme. Please note that it will take at one (1) overnight work sessions to complete the modification works. This method statement will be reviewed and amended to improve the aspects of safety and quality based on the actual conditions.

## 7. Construction Methods / Construction Sequence Drawings
Since the existing LV switchboard was planned to install 2 nos. of new fused switch on dummy compartment for the power supply to Kitchen, the measurement of busbar is required to verify whether the space or extension of busbar allow for the new fused switch installation. The 2 nos. of new fused switch will be housed in LV switchboard Panel 8 or 12 as below single line busbar diagram and LV switchboard elevation, depending on the vacancy of arrangement inside abovementioned cubicles.

During busbar measurement, a temporary power suspension is required. The affected circuit is highlighted in yellow as per Appendix A. The affected services should be verified on site.

### Procedure of Measurement

#### Preparation:
1. Work Notice Form and registration on Engineering Works and Traffic Information Management System (ETMS) shall be submitted by CSCE.
2. An exact date has been further coordinated with relevant parties and stated in Section 5 -"Programme and Working Hours" of this method statement.

#### Before Measurement:
1. To ensure the Work Notice Form and ETMS registration have been accepted.
2. To ensure method statement and risk assessment have been accepted by MTR.
3. To ensure Permit-to-Work (PTW) has been issued by REW before carrying out works.
4. Warning labels should be displayed to remind that electrical works is in progress.
5. To ensure detail schedule of work activities have been accepted as attached in Appendix B.
6. To ensure emergency communication lines have been established.
7. If necessary, the F.S. systems, such as direct link and FM200 protected room will be isolated before any switching.
8. CP is responsible to supervise and brief to the workers about LV switchboard to be inspected and the potential risks.
9. CP shall ensure all team members well understand their corresponding accountabilities and responsibilities for the tasks.
10. Temporary earthing bonding shall be provided and connected between existing LV switchboard and earthing terminal in prior.
11. A live line test should be conducted before applying earthing, and electrical insulating gloves should be worn during the installation of temporary earthing.
12. The rear of panel 7 of MSB 2.2 (panel for incomer SHD504) should not be opened during the inspection work. Temporary barriers and warning signage should be placed.
13. CP and workers shall sign the briefing record for identification and record as attached in Appendix C.
14. CP & WPIC shall ensure all workers and team members are well equipped with personal protection equipment (PPE) including hard helmets, safety shoes, reflective vests, and insulating gloves for the tasks.
15. CP & WPIC shall notify the depot/yard master prior the work.
16. Power shut down of the LV switchboard will be arranged, implementation of Lock-Out Tag-Out (L.O.T.O.) procedure as attached in Appendix D. All outgoing load fused switches will be switched off manually one by one, and the incoming ACB SHD504 and Section ACB 533 will be switched off by remote control from Power System Controller (PSC). These ACBs will be also locked by REW to prevent re-energisation. The key of the ACBs will be kept by the REW.
17. Check the all live parts have been shut down, isolation, proofing dead by using of meter, applying of portable earth lead(s) of circuit in order to fulfil operational needs or facilitate electrical works.

#### During Measurement:
1. Ensure electrical power of ACB is isolated in remote control by Power Supply Controller (PSC) before carrying out work.
2. Open the back panel cover of LV switchboard.
3. Measure the busbar of existing LV switchboard.
4. Photos shall be taken for record.

#### After Measurement:
1. Make sure all the tools and equipment are removed and cleared away from Panel nos. 8 and 12 of Switchboard MSB 2.2.
2. Reinstate the back covers of Panel nos. 8 and 12 of Switchboard MSB 2.2 and check that the panel is fully enclosed.
3. The LV switchboard will be re-energised, in accordance with the Lock-Out Tag-Out procedure. The incoming ACBs will be drawn into the cradle and switched on by remote control from Power System Controller (PSC). Then, the outgoing MCCBs will be switched on one by one.
4. Check whether the power supply to each area is normal. If there are any abnormalities with the electrical installation, switchboard sub-contractor will provide technical support for the LV switchboard within 30 minutes after re-energisation.
5. Confirm the whole system has returned normal and Permit-to-Work shall be cancelled by AP afterwards.

## 8. Safety (Risk Assessments)
Risk Assessment attached in Appendix A has been prepared for all general activities. Specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow. The Construction Team Leader together with the RSO, will supervise the implementation and make adjustment according to the actual site operations, in order to maintain a safe and amicable working environment.
