                "Diagram B": "Please refer to following table for condition of cable ducts based on site observation:  | Cable Duct No. | Condition | Treatment | | -------------- | --------- | --------- | | 1 | Empty | To be removed | | 2 | 11kV Electrical Supply | To be slewed away from PMO footprint | | 3 | HV Equipment Signal | To be slewed away from PMO footprint | | 4 | Empty | No action | | 5 | Empty | No action | | 6 | 11kV Electrical Supply | No action |  3. Cable duct No. 1 shall be removed as it is an empty duct .The duct shall be cut using an angle grinder and carted away. Once completed, both open ends shall be sealed usin gexpanding PU foam spray. 4. The remaining two cable ducts within the PMO footprint which are cable duct No. 2 (11kV Electrical Supply) and No. 3 (HV Equipment Signal) shall be slewed away from PMO footprint(refer to Diagram B). 5. Cable duct No. 3 shall be cut ope nusing hammer and chisel to avoid contact with existing HV equipment signal cables withi nthe duct .Once cutting is completed, the duct shall be removed carefully. 6. For cable duct No. 2, aqualified electrician shall detect, identify and verify the cable connection to AB16 (identificatio nmethod is attached in Appendix C). 7. Once verified, asmall hole opening shall be made at the PVC duct jointing using a hammer and screwdriver following Diagram C. This is to allow for pouring of joint filler to protect the cable and insertion of PVC pipe cutter.",
                "Diagram C": "8. Once the hole has been opened, join tfiller shall be poured into the duct until 20mm thickness is achieved .The filler is allowed to set for approximately 2 hour sbefore proceeding with pipe cuttin g(refer to Diagram D).",
                "Diagram D": "9. After the filler has set, a PVC pipe cutter shall be used to cut the duct .Once cutting is completed,the duct shall be removed carefully .With reference to Diagram D, there is sufficient clearance of 50mm to ensure safe conduct during cutting work. Nevertheless, extra car eshal lbe taken to ensure no contact with any part of the cable. 10. Prior to slewing wor kof 11kV electrical supply cable and HV equipment signal cables by hand, the power of 11kV cable must be shut off. Application to cut power and isolation of the cable shall be submitted to depot authority .Power outage time shall follow as stated under Programme and Working Hours – from 0200 to 0400 hour s(refer to Appendix D for detailed work schedule). 11. When all necessary approvals and permits have been obtained from depot authority, the power supply in AB16 shall be shut off and LO/TO system shall be applied. 12. The HV equipment signal cables shall be slewed away by hand following Diagram C. 13. The signal cables shall be enclosed using a split PVC duct tied with metal wire (refer to Diagram D).",

                "Diagram F": "14. Before commencement of 11kV cable slewing by hand, a qualified electrician will conduct a final check to ensure there is no electrical supply through the cable. Once confirmed, the cable shall be slewed away following Diagram G.",
                "Diagram G": "15. The 11kV cable shall be enclosed using a split PVC duct tied with metal wire after slewing is completed. 16. Power supply shall be switched on and doors of AB16 shall be locked. 17. Cable protectio nwarning tape shall be placed in parallel at 500mm abov ethe slewed cable ducts whe nbackfilling with sand (refer to Diagram H).",
