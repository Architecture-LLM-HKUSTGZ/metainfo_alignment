    "MTR Method Statement": {
        "1. **Introduction**": "The work area for OYB Station Northern Structure, the 2 to 4 bifurcation for TCL Down Track, and the depot edge piles along grid line ‘R’ are inside the depot area, located between the Mainline and the Test Track. New access gates will be provided to access the works area (Gate TT06, Gate TT07, and Gate TT0A) from the existing depot south road. At each access gate, a temporary diversion of the existing watermain and installation of the level crossings across the Test Track are required to access the construction area. Figures 1.1 and 1.2 show the existing condition of the work areas. In order to supply water, power, and concrete to discharge wastewater back to the south road, temporary cross-road ducts will be installed within the top ballast of the test track at each access gate.  The construction area between the Test Track and the Mainline is very narrow (8.5m to 12m wide), therefore once piling work commences, internal access through the works area will be constrained requiring the use of the level crossings together with a well-planned sequence of piling works to be adopted.  The works area will initially be fenced off with water-filled barriers followed by a temporary railway protection fence. Controlled ingress & egress at each access gate is required to prevent unauthorized entrance onto the Test Track and Main Line area. The method statement for the installation of the water-filled barrier/railway protection fence will be submitted separately.  In order to protect the existing railway infrastructure of the Test Track, such as the track and OHL mast/wire, a temporary 3.8m height gauge will be installed at each site entrance together with the level crossings.  Figure 1.3 shows the arrangement for the temporary height gauge, access gate, and level crossing at each site entrance. Figure 1.4 shows the location of Gates TT06, TT07, and TT0A; the access gates are located at least 200m East of Signal SHD57 and at least 200m West of signal SHD009, the level crossings will not affect the existing trackside equipment.",

A detailed condition survey has been conducted to ensure there is no trackside equipment/facilities around the proposed entrance gates and level crossing need to relocation. There are only two signaling sensors near the proposed level crossing near entrance gate TT06 were found close to the proposed level crossing. They are about 250mm from the level proposed level crossing and it has been discussed and the distances are confirmed acceptable to the signaling team.  During the west test track closure period, 1701 will reduce the usage of level crossing at TT06 by using access from the west test track side.",

            "8.2 Construction Sequence": "The construction sequence for the installation of the site entrance and level crossing for Gate 6, Gate 7, and Gate A is as follows: 1. Erect a temporary chain link fence at the south road to enclose the construction area. 2. Divert the existing watermain below the site entrance to provide access from the South Road to the work area. 3. Installation of height gauge at the south road side. 4. Remove the existing fence locally to form the site entrance. 5. Construct the level crossing across the test track. 6. Install the 2m height roller gauge and connect it to the height gauge. 7. Construct the cross-track duct below the Test Track. 8. Installation of height gauge at the test track side. 9. Remove the temporary chain link fence.  The detailed construction method and sequence are shown as follows.",
            "8.2.1 Erect the 2.3m Temporary Chain Link Fence with Access Gate at South Road": "The location of the proposed access gates TT06, TT07, and TT0A will be set out clearly on-site. A temporary chain link fence will be installed to fence off the work area. The chain link fence will be mounted on the South Road and secured with precast concrete blocks lifted into position with a crane lorry. This will then provide the 15m long and 3m wide work area needed for the watermain diversion, the setup as shown in Figure 8.2.1-1.  The sequence for erecting the temporary chain link fence and access is as follows:  1. Set out the locations of proposed Gates TT06, TT07, and TTOA. 2. Lift 5 nos. of 1m x 1m x 1m concrete blocks onto the south road which requires the south road to be fenced off during the lifting operation. Approval will be obtained from the Depot area, as shown in Figure 8.2.1-2. If necessary, the lifting works can be suspended and the road returned to MTR/other parties within 5 minutes if needed.",
            "8.2.2 Temp. diversion of the existing watermain to the underground area to provide access from South Road to work area": "The existing watermain is located along the existing fence adjacent to the South Road as shown in Figure 8.2.2-1.  This watermain is planned to be diverted to AB23 by Contractor 1732 by April 2024, however, CSHK intends to maintain this route for our temporary water supply. The water main will be diverted below ground locally at each site entrance by removal of the existing concrete road surface and reinstatement after completion of the diversion works.  The sequence for the watermain diversion is as follows: - Before carrying out excavation works, UU detection (under separate submission) is to be carried out by a CP, and a permit to dig issued. - A pre-job briefing is required to be given prior to the commencement of works between the CP(T), WPIC, workers, and Site Engineer for the excavation work. - Saw cut the road surface to be removed using a road saw or sthil saw. - Remove the concrete road surface using a backhoe with breaker and excavate a 200mm wide, 500mm deep, and 8m long trench. 20mm Plywood protection board will be installed on the existing RP fence. - Compact the ground by vibration plate and install the watermain in the trench. - Inform MTR/Depot, Temporary shutdown the existing watermain. - Cut the existing watermain and connect the existing and new watermain. - Backfill and compact sand on top of the diverted watermain and place a 150mm wide, 6mm thick steel protection plate on top of the sand. - Backfill and compact with 100mm thick granular subbase. - Place steel mesh and concrete the reinstatement of the pavement. The concrete grade is 40/20D, thickness is 250mm, and shall be placed manually.",
