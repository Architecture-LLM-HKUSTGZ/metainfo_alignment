            "6.2 Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS)": "Device Name: Trimble DGPS Receiver SPS356. Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) is recommended for positioning of the sailing vessel. The differential signal broadcasts at Kau Yi Chau will be integrated with the GPS data in the device to provide a real-time positioning coordinates, and the coordinates will be transformed into the Hong Kong 1980 Coordinates System. With reference to the brochure of the DGPS, the differential position accuracy is about 1m.",

                "8.1.1 Instruments": "All instruments shall be calibrated by equipment certificating company once a year. Certificate will then be issued after calibration to ensure all instrument are in good condition, Instrument without calibration certificate or with expired certificate are not allowed to use within the site area and will be labelled. Calibration certificate is attached.",
                "8.1.2 DGPS": "DGPS will be calibrated by setting it on known control station prior and after the sounding operation. The DGPS receiver will be mounted well. Satellite signal will be logged and computed for positioning comparison. If the position logged by the DGPS is within tolerance (+/-1m) of the coordinates of control station, the calibration is acceptable.",
                "8.1.3 Bar Check Method": "Bar check test will be followed to determine the correctness for the echo sounding equipment. A steel plate will be lowered underneath the transducer. The chain linked to the steel plate shall be marked with 1m interval. At the beginning, the plate will be lowered to 2m depth, to calibrate the draft of the transducer. The steel plate then will be lowered to the deepest section to be surveyed. Before the bar check, the sound velocity will be adjusted to eliminate the difference between reading and the depth of steel plate. After that, the steel plate will be raised meter by meter and the reading recorded on echo roll paper will also be checked for any discrepancy. Re-adjustment of sound velocity and calibration is necessary if the reading is different from the pre-determined depth."
            },
            "8.1.4 HDOP of Satellites": "The value of HDOP, horizontal dilution of precision, is indicating the positional precision.

Positional measurements could be used to make reliable in-route navigation suggestions to the user. | | 5-10       | Moderate  | Positional measurements could be used for calculations, but the fix quality could still be improved. A more open view of the sky is recommended. | | 10-20      | Fair      | Represents a low confidence level. Positional measurements should be discarded or used only to indicate a very rough estimate of the current location. | | >20        | Poor      | At this level, measurements are inaccurate by as much as 300 meters with a 6-meter accurate device (50 DOP x 6 meters) and should be discarded. |  The value of HDOP of satellites received during the survey will be monitored and recorded."
        },
        "8.2 Preparation of Plan lines": "Pre-assigned survey lines will be allocated to cover the entire sounding portion. The principle of designing the survey lines would either be 5m section intervals normal to the base line or 5m fixed intervals. In addition, reasonable check lines shall be performed normal to the survey line. The interval of check line usually adopted as 40m or minimal of 2-3 check lines to be adopted.",
        "8.3 Field Survey": "Survey vessel speed will be kept in a constant speed, generally 3-5 knots will be applied which causing no intolerable distortion to the sounding records. The software will be set to mark on the data file and sounding paper in every 5m. The interval will be set in distance instead of time because the sampling rate by time had been affected by speed of the boat. The marks would be evenly distributed along the cross section if marks were taken by distance intervals. The sounding will be recorded in the computer by 0.1s intervals; it means 0.15m intervals at speed of 3 knot. A minimum of 2-3 check lines should be run for ensure the quality of the sounding data.",

The corrections, such as tide, will be applied to the raw data and reduced to Hong Kong Principal Datum (H.K.P.D.). After applying the corrections, the noise, such as bubbles, fishes, unpredictable errors, will be removed. Then, the data will be reduced into point-form and the outliers will be removed by comparing the data in different survey-lines.",
            "8.5.2 Sorting": "After the data editing, the shallowest depth points will be selected, for the scale of 1:500 using A2 paper, in their true position soundings' cell size would be $D_X = 2$ $D_Y = 1$. The processing data sign should be positive within Hypack program."
