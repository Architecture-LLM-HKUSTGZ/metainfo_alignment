        "4. Programme and Working Hours (Start & finish date of operation/works)": "The tentative work commencement is scheduled in Early Feb 2024. The general working hours will be from 08:00 – 19:00 daily, from Monday to Saturday. However, it may be required to carry out works from 19:00 to 23:00 and Sunday and Public Holidays in case of essential speeding up of the working process. CSHK would check internally to fulfil the Construction Noise Permit Requirement. All the works shall be led by WPIC during the approved working period at different areas, details are summarised in the below table. Competent Person for Underground Utilities Survey shall be assigned and in the presence of works. CP(T)/CP(NT) is to look after the works not affect the safety of operating railway. Thus, CP(T)/CP(NT) is to ensure works are within CA area and any opening of the existing Manhole shall notify Depot relevant parties such as IMD in advance.",
        "5. Plant, Equipment & Material (Identify type, model and specification of MAJOR plant & equipment)": "The major equipment will be deployed to carry out the works are as follow: - For Underground Signal/Electrical Cable: - Radiodetection Precision Locator RD8200 or equivalent - Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) - Theodolite - Tape measures - Spray paint/ chalk - Removable tape - Assorted tools for opening and closing manholes - Torches - Manhole cover lifters  The specification of major plants and equipment are shown in Appendix B.",
        "6. Construction Methods": {
            "6.1 Survey Methods for Underground Signal/ Electrical Cables": "1. Prior to beginning the survey, carry out a visual inspection of the area for familiarization purposes. Photographs of each site location shall be taken and kept for reference purposes and inclusion in the report. 2. Locate the corners/ boundary of the area and mark with spray paint/ chalk. Using these points to mark out a grid pattern covering the entire survey area. If this grid overlaps the boundaries of the survey area, scans shall still be carried out over the entire grid. A grid pattern shall be used dependent on the size of the site. 3. Carry out a visual inspection of the area and locate all manholes, valves, vaults and chambers and record their location, size and type. Measurements shall be made using a tape measure. Before open any covers, relevant parties shall be informed. 4. Open all the located manholes, valves, vaults and chambers, measure, and record the depth and the form of structure. 5. For storm water and foul sewer manholes check for pipes and record the depth to the bottom of the pipe from ground level, the diameter of the pipes and the direction of flow, if any, through the pipes. Also, record and measure the dimensions, if possible, of the chamber (i.e. Depth, width & length). For power cables, Electrical & Mechanical Services cable, street lighting cables, cable TV or telecom cable manholes, record the configuration of inlet and outlet ducts and their depths to the top of the ducts. 6. Check and record all surface features relating to the underground utilities (i.e. fire hydrants, standpipes, lamp posts, bollards, traffic lights or telephone booths).",
            "6.2 Methods for Opening Cable Trough, Manhole or Draw Pit Cover": "1. Clean the surrounding loose materials and elements to avoid materials fell into the cable trough/ manholes/ draw pit. 2. Use appropriate manholes cover lifters for opening the manhole cover. Below pictures are shown several typical safe working procedures for opening heavy duty manhole cover. 3. The lifting handles are for two-handed lifting. 4. Locking nut on the threaded key section shall be secured with the key in place tightly on the cover. 5. Worker shall check the key nut fully insert to the cover hole to reduce risk of dropping cover. 6. Carefully lift up the cover simultaneously with two workers, and then place the cover onto the flat ground. 7. After completion of UU survey, workers shall reverse the above-mentioned procedure to reinstate. 8. No worker shall enter into the Manhole unless adequate safety measure such as for confined space provided and notify Depot relevant parties. Barrier shall be provided to fence off any opening for safety. The opening shall be closed as soon as possible and do not allow it remain open when not attended."
        },
        "7. Precaution and Preparation Before Commencement of Works": "- Fully Supervision at all times shall be provided at work fronts, especially for the location with significant interfaces with SHD daily operation or other construction works within depot. - Temporary Protective Fence will be installed to isolate work fronts from MTR/s tracks as required in the contract. - Advanced coordination and communication shall be made with interfacing contractors to facilitate works nearby. - For lifting works by crane lorry or crane, the operator shall ensure a clear and unrestricted view of the load carried in prior to lifting works. - CP shall report to depot before works could commence and brief safety rules to workers before commencement of work.",
        "8. Safety (Risk Assessments)": {
            "8.1 General Safety": "- All workers shall attend a site-specific induction course conducted by Safety Team. The Safety Officer shall explain the necessary safety requirements as identified in the Risk Assessment Record and the Construction Manager/ Engineer / Foreman in charge of the work shall explain the system of work to his supervisors and workers. - All workers shall be equipped with reflective vests and safety helmets during operation. All workers must go through a briefing by the Construction Manager / Safety Officer / Safety Supervisor before commencement of any works. All workers on site shall obtain an approved \"Mandatory Basic Safety Training Certificate\". - Toolbox talk training with reference to the recommended safety and environmental control measures after Construction Risk Assessment will be provided to the site personnel prior to commencing works. - A pre-meeting will be arranged before commencement of the work among Foreman / Engineer / Construction Manager, MTR’s representatives and Safety Department to brief the nature of works, the safety aspects and the requirements. - Safety helmets fitted with chin straps must be worn within the site, safety boots, hearing protectors (if needed), high visibility jackets / sashes, reflective vest, goggles, gloves and full body harnesses for work at height will be provided to all staff working on site. Warning signs and barriers will be erected where necessary. - Particular care needs to be taken when working on or near busy roads. No works will be undertaken unless safe access, including approved and fully implemented TTM / TTAs where necessary. The voltage of any handheld power tools should not exceed 110V and preferably be less than 24V.  Any emergency situation shall be reported to Subcontractor and Contractor (i.e. Construction Manager/ Engineer / Foreman and Safety Department, etc.) for prompt response. The emergency contact list is shown in Appendix C.",
            "8.2 Risk Assessment": "The risk for the works shall be assessed and the Risk Assessment Analysis is shown in Appendix D."
