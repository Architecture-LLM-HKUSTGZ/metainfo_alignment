        "7. Construction Methods / Construction Sequence Drawings": "1. Logistics Arrangement: Plant, Labour and Material 1.1 Access to Works Area W2, W3, W7, W11 & W12 (W4,W6 at separated connection point) According to BUGN2023/21, once works areas declared as Construction Areas (CAs), RSI training and EDOC are not required, but for works less than 10m measuring from nearest rail, EDOC and CP(T) supervision is required. Initially, when the vehicular access bridge is not ready for delivery, we would temporarily utilize west gate via the west level crossing to deliver the plant and material. During delivery from West gate, escort vehicle with CPs would be deployed to escort the construction vehicles. CP(T) would be stationed at the West level crossing to check the vehicular height and direct the traffic and communicate with the yard master continuously. Apart from the construction vehicles, shuttle escorted by escort car will be arranged to directly carry worker from West Gate to the Container Village at W11 via the West level crossing.  Contractors would utilize the East gate once the vehicular access bridge is ready to use. Safety procedure similar to West Gate would be deployed. Details arrangement shall refer to security and traffic management under separate submission.  Nonetheless, we would hold regular workshops with RP/Yard master to go through current works within all CAs in order to identify and review any impact upon railway and/or depot operation. The rules and procedures for Railway Protection under the Railway Ordinance will be in accordance with Practice Note for Authorized Persons, Registered Structural Engineers and Registered Geotechnical Engineers (PNAP ADV-33 / APP-24). Details traffic and security arrangement shall refer to separate submission.  1.2 Access to Works Area W1 For the OYB-South bifurcation, both labour and plants would be delivered via temporary access Gate at slip road underneath Shun Long Road to W1. (Details refer to traffic and security management plan under separate submission). To avoid vehicle, damage the existing RP Fence, water-filled barrier will be installed approximately 1m away from the fence as crushing barrier.  2. Arrangement of Temporary Water Supply at Siu Ho Wan Depot There is one 700mm dia. government fresh water main on the western side of the site (generally referring to Figure 1.1), and one 200mm dia. water connection will be provided for us to use for subsequent pipework of temporary water supply. Connection work and pipework for provision of temp. water supply arrangement would just be carried out after CA declarations. While for OAs, all workers should have qualification of RSI. Before commencement of any task, working hours and arrangement would be reported to Yard Master and should follow the work flow of ETMS. In addition, processes of the task should be supervised by CP(T) all the times.  2.1 Temporary Water Supply (Stage 1) Before completion of the said pipework/watermain diversion for bifurcation, temporary water will be proposed to source from existing water main on the South Road at Siu Ho Wan Depot, and we shall apply for the approval from Depot Yard Master to connect tee joints and water meters to Area W11 and W2 (detail as below, EDOC is required) in the purpose of construction. Meanwhile, this issue would be further coordinated with MTR CWBU and Depot in due course.  2.2 Temporary Water Supply to Various Construction Works Area (Stage 2) Discharging water from Tai Ho Interchange (THI) and installing tee joints are here considered as applicable measures to achieve temporary water supply on Stage 2. Firstly, Form WWO 542 with a plan showing the proposed location and size of the pipeworks at the boundary of the work site shall be submitted to WSD. Then, connection work will be carried out by a licensed plumber after receiving approval by the Water Authority. After this, we will connect 100mm diameter pipe to the WSD water supply connection point to fit our follow-up work for extension of water pipe (sapphire dotted line) to each Works Area. Overall arrangement is shown in Figure 1.3. The detail of the tee joint can refer to Figure 1.4.  Besides, water pipes shall be laid next to the edges of road kerbs to minimize the impact to traffic.  2.2.1 Area W12, W3 & W7 100mm dia. PE water pipe shall be used for provision in W12, and 50mm dia. PE water pipe will be used in W3 and W7. Temporary Water Supply Routing Layout (Stage 2) refers to Figure 1.6. In addition, to provide accessible road, approximate 200mm deep cover recess (red dotted circle illustrated in Figure 1.6) should be provided to hide water pipe when the pipe crosses the road transversely. Detail of recess is showing in Figure 1.5.  Work for recess with pipe should be carried out as following steps: a. Using floor saw/hand held saw to cut through an approximate 150mm-wide area on the concrete hard pavement; b. Break up concrete hard pavement by backhoe and clear away concrete fragments; c. Lay water pipe onto the recess; d. Backfill subbase to the road level to cover the water pipe and place one piece of 60mm thk. steel plate.  Considering to maintain vehicular access, captioned recess with pipework is just carried out to one lane of the road first, then turns to another lane.  Additionally, as the Tee off to PMO (site office), the swabbing & sampling will be carried out for W7 before the usage of portable water (under separate submission).  2.2.2 Area W11 & W2 After the main water supply point is ready for connection from THI, water pipe reaching test track is required to cross the railway track via the west level crossing to supply water for W11 and W2 (routing refers to Figure 1.6). 100mm dia. PE pipe shall be used.  For water pipe crossing the test tracks/level crossing, one 150mm PVC sleeve pipe is embedded in the ballast (parallel to the sleepers), and then the 100mm dia. PE pipe shall be laid inside the PVC pipe. Details of level-crossing pipe may refer to Figure 1.7. Install one water tee joint with one valve gate to the main 100mm dia. PE water pipe every 50m.  2.2.3 Area W1 For Works Area W1, the total area is approximately 700㎡. Water pipes would be connected from Tai Ho interchange via 75mm dia. PE pipe for upcoming pre-drilling works. The alignment of pipeline is proposed to be placed inside surface channel to W1. We will coordinate with C7 contractor for the temporary water pipe routing of THI.  2.2.4 Area W4, W5 & W6A & W6B Temporary water will be given from nearby existing water mains at Siu Ho Wan Depot, and we shall apply for the approval from Depot Yard Master to connect tee joints to discharge water to Area W4, W5 & W6B. Further coordination will be carried out with Depot in due course. And method statement will be submitted separately.  3. Hand over the water meter from other contractor to 1701 Arrange a site inspection for the water meter hand over from 1732 to 1701 (first batch Layout plan attached in Appendix C). Record the current reading of the water meter in the form of a photograph. The meter readings will be submitted to MTRC every month.  4. Installation a new water meter at W3B, AB16, South Road (Near Grid 68) 1. Determine which pipe is used for floor washing, 2. Turn off the existing gate valve and remove the air valve, 3. Install the new gate valve and the suitable water meter, 4. Install the old air valve, step 2, 3 & 4 to be carried out by licensed plumber, 5. Record the current reading of the water meter in the form of a photograph, 6. The meter readings will be submitted to MTRC every month.",
