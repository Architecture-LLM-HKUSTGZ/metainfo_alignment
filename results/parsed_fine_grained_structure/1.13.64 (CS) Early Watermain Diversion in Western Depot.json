    "Early Watermain Diversion in Western Depot": {
        "1. Introduction": "This method statement describes the methodology and sequence of work for the diversion of the existing water mains including fresh, flushing and cleansing water, in order to provide sufficient working area without disruption to the existing water supply to the Depot. There are two stages of diversion work described under this method statement. The first stage is the diversion work completed before the installation of the temporary RP fencing along the West Depot Entry Track where the existing mains are required to be removed or diverted to allow piling work to proceed, i.e. Works Area W12, AB11 and NDB08. The second stage shows the arrangement of the watermains after the RP fencing has been installed. The details of each stage are described herein.",

        "3. Details of Sub-Contractor/Specialist Sub-Contractor": "The works will be carried out by our subcontractor, Wing Wo, and supervised by our front-line staff such as foreman and engineer. We will also provide full time CP(T) (Railway Safety Rules and Requirements) on site with 1 CP(T) appointed for every 20 workers at each work area. All workers shall be RSI trained as the diversion works are required to be undertaken within Operation Areas (OA). In addition, a WPIC will be assigned to supervise the construction works at each work site.",

        "7. Construction Methods / Construction Sequence Drawings": {
            "1. **Preparatory Work**": "- All site investigation and diversion work to the existing watermains must be carried out with care. The condition of the existing underground utilities may need further clarification with MTR and other Contractors if they are unknown. As parts of the existing watermain are close to the operating railway an approved EDOC is required to be issued for works in the OA to ensure no interruption to the operation of the depot, test track and barging point at any time. Access to and through the site shall be in accordance with the Traffic and Security Management Plan submitted separately.",
            "2. **Statutory Submission**": "- Submit WWO 542 before commencement of any plumbing works. - Submit WWO 046 PartⅠ& Ⅱ to WSD to report commencement of works. - Submit WWO 046 Part Ⅳ to WSD for reporting of completion of diverted mains.",

Figure 7.3.1 - Alignment of Existing Watermain and Facilities in Western Depot  To facilitate our planned diversion of the existing watermain in Works Area W12 and as required under the Contract Scope, the existing Water Meter Building (AB28) and associated E&M facilities are to be removed (under separate submission). The removal work shall be further coordinated with the Depot and an approved EDOC for the removal works is required (to be submitted separately). A temporary water meter (Figure 7.3.2) will be installed near AB25 before removal of AB28.  Figure 7.3.2 - Temporary Water Meter  A temporary water tank will be provided to supply water to AB24 (existing west train wash facility) before removal of the existing water tank adjacent to AB24. The size/ volume of the new water tank shall be same as the existing one. As the temporary water tank is located further from AB24 the connecting pipework will be of an increased length, therefore the existing water flow rate must be maintained to ensure normal functioning of AB24. The design of the water supply shall be made under separate submission. The proposed location of the temporary water tank is shown in Figure 7.3.3. Installation work shall be in accordance with the following sequence:  - Lift the temporary water tank to the proposed location (refer to Appendix F for the lifting plan). - Connect the temporary watermain to the temporary water tank. - Turn off the main water valve of the Depot and disconnect the existing water pipe currently feeding AB24. Then, connect the temporary watermain from the temporary water tank to AB24. The arrangement for this change-over work is described in section 3.3.1 Change-Over of Pipe. - Lift the existing water tank for removal off site using the crane lorry as shown in Appendix F.  Figure 7.3.3 – Proposed Location of Temporary Water Tank",
