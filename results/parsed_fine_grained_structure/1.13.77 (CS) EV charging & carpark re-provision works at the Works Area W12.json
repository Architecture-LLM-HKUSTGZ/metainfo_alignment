Follow the method in step 2 and install the steel frame (three in total) at the boundary line of the existing parking shed that needs to be removed. The steel frame is welded to the existing roof. According to the existing steel framing plan for the car park, the steel framing is divided into 4 demolition areas and 1 reserved area. The weight of the roof of each demolition area is approximately 200kg. First, use a lorry crane to lift area 1 to prevent it from falling during dismantling. Workers use a handheld electric cutting machine to cut the corrugated steel plate at the junction of area 1, area 2, and the reserved area. Remove the connection bolt between the channel and beam, and place the removed top plate on the lorry crane. Follow these steps to dismantle areas 2-4. Remove the connection bolt between the column and beam, using a lorry crane to lift the beam. Then use a cutting machine to cut and remove the original steel frame.",
