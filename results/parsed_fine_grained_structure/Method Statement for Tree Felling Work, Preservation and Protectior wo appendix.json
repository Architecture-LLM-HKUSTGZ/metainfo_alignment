            "6.3 Tree Felling": {
                "6.3.1 Sequence Of Tree Felling Works By Climbing (Scenario 1)": "- Tree Felling will comply with the standard of American National. Standard for Arboricultural Operations (ANSI Z133) - Safety Requirements. - Before starting any tree felling work, the supervisor will coordinate with site representative to ensure that no trees are felled wrongly. All trees to be felled shall be confirmed and double-checked by the Supervisor. - Cherry picker/ working platform/ crane lorry will be used, if necessary, to facilitate the removal of tree by pieces and it will be temporarily parked inside the site only. During the working at height on the trees, the workers shall wear the proper personal protective equipment including protective shoes, goggles, gloves, safety helmet with chin-strap, reflective vest, and safety harness. - A temporary working area will be cordoned off and alert others and against the hazards of falling objects. - The tree will be felled piece by piece using rigging/ cherry picker/ working platform which will be started from tip of branch piece by piece until all branches removed. Then the trunk shall remove from top to the bottom also piece by piece above ground level. - The tree workers will get to the crown of the slope trees by tree climbing if necessary, depending on site constraint shall also consider the risk of electrocution, especially if branches being fell off to the overhead line. This might cause serious injury to the staff and any workers nearby. The tree workers who climb the tree should be qualified tree worker. Starting the tree felling, the worker will cut the crown pieces by pieces with poles saws or chainsaws after holding the branches firmly by min.12mm rope to ground or any suitable rigging points. - In general, for branches with Diameter at breast height (DBH) between 100mm to 300mm, maximum length of each piece should be 5 m. For branches with DBH 300mm, maximum length of each piece should be 2m. However, the dimension of the cut pieces could be adjusted based on the on-site situation including target availability, slope gradient and the presence of buffers, for example, for the trees adjacent to public road, maximum size of cut piece should limit to 1.5m in length to reduce risk. For higher target availability, the cut branches will be lifted by min.12mm rope to the ground safely so that the lowering of cut limbs and stumps to avoid causing injury to person and damage to property. After the cutting of branches, the main trunk will be held firmly by the min.12mm ropes to limit its movement. Then the trunk will be cut at trunk base. Then the trunk will be laid onto the ground by the min.12mm ropes and will be cut into pieces that can be removed by the grab lorry from the site. - There might be some minor adjustment of the felling procedure in account of the onsite situation, with the same safety manner. - Tree trunks and branches shall be removed in pieces for reasons of safety and to such a manner that any potential damage to the public and adjacent railway utilities, services or pipes, structures, slopes or stream course vegetation is avoided. Care should be taken to avoid damaging such facilities. - Other existing trees to be retained adjacent to the trees to be felled shall be maintained properly, care should be taken to avoid damaging any structures or neighbouring trees, stubs, grass or surfaces.",
                "6.3.2 Sequence Of Tree Felling Works (Scenario 2)": "- Position the mobile crane and aluminium foldable mobile tower on ground at optimum distance from tree to be felled. - Fence off the tree felling work area before operation. - Securely tie the chain saw to the man cage of aluminium foldable mobile tower or aerial working platform to avoid chain saw falling. - Tagline should be fastened to the tree branch which will be cut. - The cutting shall be started from the tallest branches to the lower branches. - Fasten and tie one end of the tree branch to be felled with min.12mm heavy-duty rope by the skilled workmen in the man cage and the other end of the min.12mm rope to be attached to the crane's b in order to control the felling down position of the tree branch. - Cut the bottom of the tree branch with the chain saw at about 1 inch depth. - The cut section of branch / truck shall be slowly brought down and directed to a safe location within the work area. The cutting length for all diameter of trunk shall be 500mm with safe working load 1 ton. - The stump shall be removed by hand grubbing and winching; stump cutting machine: hydraulic lifting or other method approved by the Engineer. - The felled tree branches and trunk shall be cut into pieces and removed offsite at the end of each working day to our nursery for mulching or compost.",
                "6.3.3 Rigging System": "- Rigging system shall be used to control the falling zone of the tree branches during removing the trees located near the road or foot path."

            "6.4 Tree To Be Retained": "- The tree will be fenced Temporary Protective Fencing shall be 1200m high comprising straining corner posts, intermediate straining posts, and bamboo pales. - End straining posts shall be 150x150x1800mm long timber posts driven 600mm into ground. Posts shall be installed at corners, ends of runs and at 10m centers. - Intermediate posts shall be 100x100x1800mm timber posts driven 600mm into ground at 2000 centers. - Bamboo pales shall be hand-driven from bamboo poles of approximately 30mm diameter. Pales shall be 1200mm long and notched 80mm from the top. Pales shall be positioned at not more than 50mm spacing. - Line wires shall consist of two numbers of 2mm diameter galvanized steel wires twisted together. Pales shall be fixed between the twisted wires. A first line wire shall be fixed 150mm from the top of the pales and second line wire shall be fixed 200mm from the ground level. A third line wire shall be fixed equally spaced between the other two. Fixing to intermediate timber posts shall be galvanized steel staples. Wires shall be fixed to end posts by running two complete turns round the post with the wire twisted back on itself and staples driven tightly into the post. - All protected trees to be watered twice a week around tree base. - Oil, petrol, creosote and other toxic chemicals must be kept away from the root spread. - Site fires must be kept well away from the trees and roots. Hot air and fumes will also cause damage. - If existing hard pavement around a tree is to be removed which exposes tree roots, pavement must be replaced immediately with top soil or sand to prevent surface roots from drying out. - Care must be taken to protect the trees from any physical damages during the erection and dismantling of scaffolding and temporary works. - Any cuts incurred shall be dressed immediately according to acceptable horticultural practice. - Extra care should be given to the tree within close distance of any possible excavation area; no form of root pruning is allowed unless requested and approved by Landscape Architect and Architect. - Acidic fluid or any other chemical waste the works to be used for shall not be allowed to be splashed onto any part of the trees or drained to the pit of the tree.",
            "6.5 Tree To Be Transplanted": "- Trees to be transplanted were marked with labels which are shown in Construction Drawing. - Except those trees required to house in the temporary nursery, that have been dug for transplanting should be planted as soon as possible. - Cover a root ball with damp material which will retain moisture (burlap, peat moss, etc.). - Pre-water holes before planting in dry soils. This prevents initial post-planting water from migrating away from the root ball. - The rootball for transplanting and pruning of the tree roots shall be conducted. - Using 8 to 10 times the DBH (diameter of the tree trunk measured at 1.3m from soil level of adjacent ground) or at most 2.5m (due to the logistic limit for trees transporting the truck) as diameter, mark out a circle on the around the tree as a guide to indicate the diameter of the root-ball to be provided for the tree. A wider rootball that can be handled conveniently shall allow the tree a better chance of surviving the transplanting. - Using a sharp spade drive the blade to full depth around the circumference of the circle in only two opposing segments, to sever the roots along the section to a depth of approximately 2 spits deep. - After certain regeneration period, repeat the above mentioned step for the next two opposite segments. - After a period since the last root pruning, prepare the root ball as specified and cut the underside of the root ball at 1.2m from soil level of adjacent ground. followed by uplifting and transplanting. - The tree shall be fully supported by guy wires and/or steel members, in accordance with the size of the tree, at all times. - Crown thinning will not be considered to be carried out to all transplanted trees except the trees subject to the limitation of the logistic arrangement. Crown thinning will be carried out at the same time when root pruning is conducted to reduce water consumption by the tree. In total no more than 20% of the crown shall be pruned and the crown shall be maintained in well-balanced form. The following key procedures shall be observed: - Safety precautions shall be taken to protect those engaged in the operations, and people and properties in the vicinity. - The tool for the pruning works shall be sharp to ensure clean cuts. - The central main leader of the tree shall not be pruned. (no topping) - Generally, pruning cuts should be made just outside the branch collar as Figure 3. The branch collar contains trunk or parent branch tissue and should not be damaged or removed. If the trunk collar has grown out on a dead limb to be removed the cut will be made just beyond the collar, without cutting the collar. - When the tree is ready to be transplanted upon completion of root and crown pruning, the spreading branches shall be tied to protect the branches from tearing when lifting and transporting the tree. - Cut around the circumference of the root zone around the tree to ensure all protruding roots are severed. - Any loose soil around the shoulder of the outline for the rootball shall be eased off. - Use the spade to cut off the rest of the roots from the rootball that was not cut previously and then thrust the spade underneath the rootball at an angle of 45 degrees to cut off to prevent damage during lifting and transiting. - The tree shall be tied from at least 2 points to be lifted from the ground and carefully loaded onto a truck. - The above mentioned preparation works are for trees up to semi-mature size trees. For mature and older trees the rootball shall be protected by a wooden container. - Upon lifting from the ground and during transit the tree shall be protected against excessive sunlight, wind and drought. Care shall be taken in packing to prevent overheating that results in loss of foliage due to excessive evapotranspiration. - Lifting and unloading of the tree shall be provided with the same care to prevent the splitting of the trunks and broken"
