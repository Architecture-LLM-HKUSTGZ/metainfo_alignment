        },
        "4. Programme and Working Hours (Start & finish date of operation/works)": "The work commencement is scheduled in late May 2024. The proposed tentative occupation period for the strip footing area is from 20/5/2024 to 20/2/2025 (~9 months). The general working hours will be from 08:00 - 19:00 daily, from Monday to Saturday. All the works shall be led by WPIC during the approved working period.",
        "5. Plant, Equipment & Material (Identify type, model and specification of MAJOR plant & equipment)": "All plants and equipment will be inspected prior to the mobilization on site to ensure that they are in good working condition and comply with the current regulations. The major equipment will be deployed to carry out the works are as follows and the technical specification is attached in Appendix D:  - Temporary water-filled barriers - Grab-mounted lorry - Vibratory rammer - Steel Plates (20mm) - Lifting crane (60T)",
        "6. Construction Methods/Construction Sequence": "All workers should have RSI training. A pre-job briefing is required prior to the commencement of works between the CP workers and Site Engineers to ensure the workers are fully informed of the risks and they are aware of the measures to control those risks.  1. Fencing off the works area by water-filled barriers and setup warning signs. Unauthorized persons are not allowed to enter. 2. Concreting at two sides of the strips as a retaining wall. And concreting around the existing manhole for protection. 3. Using PVC pipe as weepholes at the side of mass concrete to drain away excess water. 4. Layered backfill upon the strip footings by a grab-mounted lorry. Backfill materials shall be temporarily stockpiled at proper areas and covered properly if backfilling cannot be completed in time to prevent flying dust. 5. All fill material shall be free from organic substances and all superficial materials such as vegetation and loose organic topsoil should be removed before placement of fill. Boulders greater than 150mm in diameter shall not be used as fill material. 6. Compact the soil by vibratory rammers and cover with a steel plate. 7. Formation of ramp for crane access. 8. Deliver Lifting crane.  The proposed area for mobilization of the crane is shown in the layout plans attached in Appendix A. The size shall be 11m x 10m and will be subjected to actual site conditions.",
        "7. Safety (Risk Assessments)": "All workers shall be equipped with reflective vests and safety helmets during operation. All workers must go through a briefing by the Construction Manager/Engineer/Safety Officer/Safety Supervisor before commencement of any works.  A pre-meeting will be arranged before commencement of the work among Survey Team, Construction Team, and Safety Team to brief the nature of works, the safety aspects, and the necessary safety requirements as identified in the Risk Assessment in Appendix C.  To ensure the worker carrying out the inspection pit excavation works are fully informed of the risks and they are aware of the measures to control those risks, the Briefing will be provided before operation commences.  Safety helmets fitted with chin straps must be worn within the site, safety boots, hearing protectors (if needed), high visibility jackets/sashes, reflective vests, goggles, gloves, and full-body harnesses for work at height will be provided to all staff working on site. Plastic barriers and reflective traffic cones will be prepared prior to work commencement to demarcate the working area.  Any emergency situation shall be reported to site supervisors (i.e. Construction Manager/Engineer/Foreman etc.) and Safety Department for prompt response. The emergency contact list is shown in Appendix E.  The risk for the works shall be assessed and the Risk Assessment Analysis is shown in Appendix C.",
        "8. Environmental (Environmental aspect & impact identification as well as mitigation measures)": "The following mitigation measures will be followed:  - General works shall be carried out during normal working hours (08:00 to 18:00). No works using PME will be carried out after 07:00 pm on Sunday and public holiday without a valid construction noise permit. - ULSD Diesel will be used in all PME. - Plant with QPME label will be employed if available. - Only regulated NRMM with NRMM label to be used on site. - All chemicals will be placed on drip tray. - Any wastewater produced during the work will be treated prior to disposal. - Backfilled material will be stocked pile at designated area, covered properly to prevent dust generation and reused on site prior to disposal. - The works shall follow relevant mitigation measures as required under the Environmental Permit (EP) / EP submission and Contractor's Environmental Management Plan (EMP).",
        "9. Quality Control (Inspection and Test Plan including hold points)": "Refer to Appendix B for Inspection and Test Plan.  - Construction works shall be fully complied with Quality Plan. - To ensure the attainment of the required standard of works, the methods of working and the required works standards/acceptance criteria are defined in the method statement, inspection & test plans, and are communicated to relevant staff and workers carrying out the works. Day-to-day routine inspections of the works will be carried out by the Construction Team Leader, Site Engineers, and Foreman as appropriate, to ensure that all works are performed following the requirements of these documents. - Specific quality checks shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Inspection & Test Plan with \"Hold Points\" at critical elements for confirmation of compliance before proceeding further. - For work activity which is classified as “Quality Hold Point”, no subsequent work can be started unless the former work activity was inspected and accepted by MTR's inspectorate. - Request for Inspection and Survey Check (RISC) shall be issued to the RSS following inspection of the works by the CSHK's project team. The Inspection & Test Plan for the works (Appendix B) will identify all Hold Points and Witness Points. - Following the Inspection & Test carried out, inspection and/or test records are to be prepared to indicate whether the specified requirements have been met. Records of Inspection and testing will be maintained and kept available for inspection and final handover as appropriate.",
