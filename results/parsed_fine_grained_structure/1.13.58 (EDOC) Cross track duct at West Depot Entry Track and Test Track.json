Description Of Works": "4.1 Title **Contract 1701 –** Cross track duct at West Depot Entry track and test track 4.2 Reason For the future Oyster Bay Station (South) and associated works construction, foundation and superstructure works are to be carried out. To facilitate the construction works for the foundation works in W2 (area between Test Track and mainline) and in W11 (area between North and South Roads), temporary water supply, power supply and temporary drainage system shall be set up and provided for construction works. The temporary services shall be passed through existing tracks including West Depot Entry Track (WDET) and Test Track (TT) to the construction areas. Cross track ducts (as pipe sleeve) shall be installed underneath the existing track for the installation of temporary services 4.3 Description A. **General** 1701 Contractor will carry out the installation of cross track ducting at West Depot Entry Track and Test Track respectively as per correlated latest approved method statement for temporary water supply with cross track duct under **ACC Ref No. 1701-W-000-CSC-760-000132.** Precaution measures for various potential risks/situation have been reviewed and summarized in the hazard log referring to Appendix B.",

Once the location has been set out a joint inspection will be held with MTR's representatives on site and other stakeholders or the land owner's/ occupier's representatives to agree the location prior to further execution. At locations where the proposed cross track duct is unlikely to or dangerous to access for either installation or later monitoring works, relocation shall be considered. In principle, one PVC pipe sleeve to be installed between sleepers. As shown the following Figure-4.  ![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)",
                "Figure-4 Arrangement Of Cross Track Duct At Test Track": "Referring to the railway safety requirements and construction drawings, if the proposed cross track duct is close to the OHL mast/track, CSHK will further verify the site conditions with MTR/ Depot Yard Master (DYM) representatives onsite to ensure that the proposed location meets the minimum safety distance and take relative precautions, such as deenergize, isolation, relocation…etc.",
                "C.2 Cable Detection": "Utility detection and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey will be carried out after the area is fenced off and after the obstacle above ground are cleared.
