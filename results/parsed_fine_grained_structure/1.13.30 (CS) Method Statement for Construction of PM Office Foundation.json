See attachment for diversion details. |  There is one 150mm diameter sewage pipe under PM office footprint. The depth of the sewage pipe is 1.5m from ground level. As the sewage pipe is below but close to the footing foundation, concrete surround method to be applied for protecting this sewage pipe.  A 3-tonnage backhoe to excavate 1200mm deep trench approx. 300mm above the existing sewage pipe then manually excavate to expose the whole section of existing sewage pipe by spade and concrete surround to this existing sewage pipe. The concrete surround details refer to the DSD standard drawing no. DS 1049B. During the excavation period, WPIC and CPT shall fully supervise the work. Open excavation with maximum 300 slope is applied to the excavation work. Soil stairs with cement harden treatment is applied to the access. Metal hand rail will be installed at both side of the access. All the excavation area will be fenced off by using plastic barriers with rebar poles fixing to the ground.  There is one 525mm diameter stormwater pipe under the footprint of the PM office. As the location of this stormwater pipe is 2.8m deep from the ground level which is about 1.4m away from the footing, CCTV inspection will be applied to keep monitoring the condition of the existing stormwater pipe. Permit to dig system will be adopted and approved prior to work commencement, the template of Permit to Dig is attached in Appendix H.",
            "6.2 Slew existing cables under PM office footprint in W7 area.": "There are 7 nos. Lamp post cables (approx. 600mm deep from existing ground level) under the PM office footprint. The Lamp post cables will be excavated manually to expose the cables then deepen the excavated trench to 1m deep from existing ground and to provide PVC split duct and concrete surround. The concrete surround details refer to the drawing no.1701/W/SHD/OAP/G06/452.  There are 10 nos. fiber and signal cables in 2 nos. 100mm PVC ducts (approx. 700mm deep from existing ground level at the south drawpit, and approx. 1500mm deep from existing ground level at the north drawpit) under the PM office footprint. After the trial pit inspection, the middle part of the cables are 1.8m deep from existing ground level. If all the cables are below the foundation level, concrete surround will be applied to protect the cables. If the cables are clashing with the foundation, slew method will be applied. The sequence is shown below. Protect the 10 existing LV cables by PVC split pipes within the existing manholes. Break out the existing manholes. Shift the cables to the west direction. To aim to slew the cables away from the PM Office foundation. Build new manholes to retain the cables.  There are two existing street lights crash with the PM office footprint. The street lights will be removed by special list sub-contractor during the diversion work of LV cables.  Application to depot authority for cutting power supply and isolation is shown below:  - Apply to depot authority for cutting power supply and isolation of the street lights. Arrange qualified electrician to test the power supply to the steer lights in advance to verify connection to AB16. - Arrange competent persons to duly sign the statuary forms or certificates or Work Permits prior to physical work. All necessary permits must be obtained from Depot before cutting power supply to the street light. The LO/TO system will be applied in the permit to work system. Permit to work form is attached in the Appendix H. - Turn off the power supply with assistance from depot authority. Make the isolation by posting the “Work in progress. Do not use/ Do not make live” safety notice that controls handle or equipment indicating that persons are working on the circuit or apparatus which must not be made live or used. See samples below.  Figure 6.2b – Work in Progress Safety Notice  - The qualified electrician MUST test the street lights first to ensure there is NO electricity leakage. - Cut off the cables by qualified electrician. Prior to cutting off, electrician MUST test on site to double check if the power is safety turned off.  Figure 6.2c – Example of Decommission of lighting.  - Insulation treatment to the cable ends. - Proper protection to the remaining power supply cables by embedded cable ducts or cable trough or withdraw back to the nearest draw pit. - Upon removal of the street light, it is suggested that the warning signage “Street light removed, Do Not Turn on” should be displayed on the Control box, subject to approval from Depot. - Upon removal of the street light, issue WR1 form to Depot.  Demolition Sequence is shown below:  - The 12m street light is divided into 2 segments, namely S1 and S2. Each segment is 6m long. - Mobile crane facilitated with cherry picker will be deployed for the cutting and lighting removal works. - Step 1 – Clear the site area for mobile crane operation. - Step 2 – Deploy the required mobile crane on site. Check the ground condition and outrigger extension points make sure the ground support is suitable for loading. The outrigger should not stand on the manholes or other weak points. TWC is required to check and issue certificate after ground condition checking. - Step 3 – Check the LA & LG safety forms and certificates before use. Handrails and toe boards shall be provided according to the safety requirement. The worker assigned to work at height shall be equipped with full body safety harness fastening to designated point or independent life wire, safety helmet, reflective vest and safety shoes. - Step 4 – Fence off the lifting zone. Post warning signage to remind no unauthorized entry. - Step 5 – Operate the cherry picker to hoist working platform to approach the S1 column. - Step 6 – Operate the mobile crane to extend the jib to overhead of the S1. Workers in the working platform of the cherry picker helps to rig with S1 to the hooks that connect to the lifting appliance of the mobile crane.  Figure 6.2c – Lifting details  - Step 8 – Maintain the S1 fastened to the mobile crane jib. Lower the working platform of cherry picker to Cut 1 that is the joint between S1 and S2 at 6m height. Flame cut carefully. Make sure no sparks area leaking out of the surrounding fire-resistant apron. Upon completion of cutting, fasten 2 pieces of tag rope at tail of S1. Lift S1 slowly to the ground. The S1 segment remaining in vertical position during the whole lifting process. When the foot of the S1 stands on the ground, slowly lower its head to the ground, taking the standing point of rotatory origin. - Step 9 – Flame cutting 2 holes in 40mm diameter with edge distance 200mm at head of S2. Hang the S2 at its head to the jib of mobile crane. - Step 10 – Flame cutting at toe of the S2. Repeat the steps aforesaid to dismantle remaining segment. Strictly implement the Permit to Lift system and 3-3-3 lifting principle to safeguard the lifting operation. Provide suitable and sufficient personal protection equipment to guarantee the safety of working at height.",
