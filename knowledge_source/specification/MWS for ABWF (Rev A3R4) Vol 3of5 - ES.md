In the case of  planting areas edge by kerbs or walls, the first row of plant  shall be planted as close to the edge as foundations will  permit.  In the case of planting areas adjacent to other planting  areas, the first row of plants shall be planted at a distance  which is half the specified planting distance for that species  from the edge, unless otherwise specified.   e  The second row shall be staggered form the first, so as to  create a triangular pattern of plants, with end side of the  triangle of the specification spacing. The pattern will be  repeated over the whole planting area.  f  All species in whip mix and shrub mix planting are to be  grouped so that between 9 and 19 plants one species are  planted in a distinct group (not in a straight line along a row).  g  In the case of mix planting, the plants shall be planted in areas  indicated on the Drawings. The approximate numbers of  plants to be planted per half day shall be set out by laying  them down beside the hole in which they are to be planted.  Plants shall not be removed from their Containers until  Planting is taking place.

LARGE SHRUB to be planted within 1.0m of the road  edge; MEDIUM SHRUB to be planted within   $0.6\mathsf{m}$   of  the road edge and SMALL SHRUB to be planted within   $0.3\mathsf{m}$   of the road edge. (The above dimensions do not  apply where crash barriers are provided between the  Planting and the carriageway or where Planting is  located within a raised planting bed).  iv.  Trees within 10m of the end of a central divider.  v.  Trees within 5m of a road lamp stand  vi.  Trees which because their location or mature size will  obscure traffic signs, signals, fire services inlets,  access panels & Overhead Line Equipment (OHLE)  etc.  vii.  Trees within 1.0m of any fire hydrant outlet or 1.5m of  any manhole covers, smoke vent, fire services inlet,  etc.  viii.

Each stake shall be a 40mm x 40mm x 6mm M.S.  angle 3500mm in length.  The stake shall be driven firmly into  the ground to enable the tree to be secured to the stake at a  point approximately 1700mm above finished ground level.  k  Guys and sleeves shall be fixed in such a manner that  chafing, rubbing and abrasion of the plant is prevented and  shall be secured to a well driven bamboo stake or other  anchor.  Each plant shall be fitted with three guys secured at a  point not higher than   $60\%$   of the overall height of the plant.    Turnbuckles shall be adjusted as necessary after Planting.  l  Tree ties shall be 7 strand galvanised wire threaded through  rubber tubing, so as to protect the tree/palm trunk and clipped  with 4 nos. of galvanised rope grips.  m  CLIMBER shall be supported at the time of Planting by a  1000mm bamboo cane which is firmly driven into the ground  to a minimum depth of 200mm.  The climber support shall be  driven into the ground close to the base of the plant, but  avoiding damage to the roots and shall lean at an angle of 60  degrees or steeper to the structure up which the CLIMBER will  grow.

At other  times of the year it is expected that water requirement for plant  establishment growth will be provided by natural rainfall which  

# Section ES 13: Landscaping Works  

under normal conditions should exceed 6mm per day on  average.  

c  The Contractor shall include details of Watering proposal for  all landscape areas in the detailed landscaping programme.  This shall include application methods, rates and programme.  

d  If Landscape Irrigation System is being used, the Contractor  shall be responsible for determining the required water  delivery during the Establishment Period and programming/  operating the irrigation system accordingly.  

e  The Contractor shall keep detailed records of the system  operation during Establishment Period and, based on the  records, develop jointly with the Employer an operating regime  to achieve maximum economy of water usage balanced with  viable, healthy soft landscape conditions throughout all  seasons, following the Establishment Period.  

Requirements hereunder have been assessed in relation to an  upper rate relating to their period and establishment for type  and planting and a lower rate relating to minimum  requirements after establishment. They are based on  accepted standards of water requirements for plants in Hong  Kong. The requirements have been determined for the 3  broad type of Planting – grass, shrubs and trees:  

i.  Grass – the water requirement for the establishment of  grass is 6mm per day or litres per   $5\mathsf{m}^{2}$   per day.  Following establishment the water requirement would  be 6mm per day or 5 litres per  $\mathsf{m}^{2}$   per day.  ii.  Shrubs – the ideal water requirement for shrubs is 6mm  per day (or 5 litres per   $\mathsf{m}^{2}$  per day) and following  establishment 8.5mm per day (or 7 litres per   $\mathsf{m}^{2}$  per  day).  iii.  Trees – Water requirements for trees are assessed in  relation to species, size, age and canopy spread.  Requirement can be estimated at 10 litres per square  metre of canopy per day. Minimum canopy spread for  trees at the time of Planting ca be estimated at   $\mathsf{1}\!\!-\!\!2\mathsf{m}^{2}$  .  

g  The programme of Watering shall relate directly to the detailed  landscaping programme and will generally be required at the  following frequencies:  

i.   $1^{\mathfrak{s t}}$   month of Establishment Period once daily  ii.   $2^{\mathsf{n d}}$   to   $6^{\mathrm{{th}}}$   month of Establishment Period twice per  week.  iii.   $7^{\mathfrak{h}}$   month to end of Establishment Period once per  week.  

# Section ES 13: Landscaping Works  

h  Plants reaching permanent wilting point shall be watered  immediately.  i  An inspection of Watering requirements shall be made in dry  weather by the Contractor and the Engineer or his/ her  representative twice weekly.  j  The Contractor shall complete Watering operations within 24  hours of an inspection which deems Watering to be  necessary.  k  Water shall be applied using an Approved hose or sprinkler  and so as not to cause compaction or washouts of soil, or  loosening of plants.  The Contractor shall immediately make  good any such damage.  

ES13 - 4.5.15  Water supply and quality  

a  Fresh and non-toxic water shall be used for Watering  landscaping areas.  b  When required, the Contractor shall obtain an analysis of  water for review.

i.  Planting in bare ground shall be maintained in a weed  free condition by the removal of all unwanted vegetative  growth over the whole planted area to the satisfaction  of the Engineer.  ii.  Planting not in bare ground shall be maintained by  removing all competing and overhanging weeds and by  cutting all grass and by keeping all areas within a  300mm radius of the base of each plant in a weed/  grass free and tidy condition.  All areas within 300mm radius of the base of each Planting  shall be kept in a weed/ grass free and tidy condition.

# Section ES 30: Zinc Double Standing Seam Roof Systems  

The flanking sound elements of the system shall be designed and  installed by the Contractor in order to control plant noise breakout  and such that the overall acoustic integrity of the whole system will  not be deteriorated.  

Where existing test data is available from a recognized independent  laboratory, it shall be considered acceptable providing the tests  have been carried out for the exact system being offered.  Test data  for  similar  constructions  may  be  accepted  if  supporting  computations are provided to account for any differences between  the proposed and tested construction.  

ES30 - 4.5.7  Access to roof  

The roof areas will require access for maintenance.  The roof systems  and all of their components are to be designed to safely allow the loads  associated with maintenance traffic without deformation or damage to the  appearance of the standing seam roof cladding.  

ES30 - 4.5.8  Loading criteria  

The completed roof systems shall accommodate the following loading  criteria without loss of structural integrity.
