# AC03 - 1.0  Description of Works  

# AC03 - 1.1  Extent of Works  

This section specifies the general requirements for Concession  Shopfronts (adopting Cabin Concept for fire safety on new projects).  The general requirements are also typically applicable for Kiosk  Shopfronts (adopting Compartment-type fire separation for older  stations prior to Lantau and Airport Railway) except as noted later in  this Section.  

The extent of Works required is indicated in the Drawings, Schedules  and or Particular Specification.  Main Related Works are referenced as  follows:

# AC03 - 1.2  Design responsibility  

# AC03 - 1.2.1  

AC03 - 1.2.2  The Engineer has designed the layout and details of Concession  Shopfront including the CONCESSION SIGN BAND, CONCESSION  OVAL SIGN, and ALUMINIUM CLADDING to various components  and interfaces with concession shutters as shown in the Drawings.   The Contractor shall develop further the details based on the  information shown in the Drawings and complete the design to satisfy  all specified requirements in this section.  The Contractor shall  submit the Shop Drawings showing the complete design in particular  the steel supporting frame, cladding fixing and detail, lighting design  and mounting method, hinged and fixed type ceiling, the preparation  and interface for installation of Building Services Items in accordance  with specified requirements.  

In this regard, the Contractor shall engage a Hong Kong Registered  Professional  Engineer  who  is  experienced  in  providing  comprehensive engineering analysis to show the completed systems'  compliance with specified requirements.  The scope of this design  service shall include the following:  

a  Sizing of supporting steelwork framing members;  b  Determination of the size and locations of fixing and connection  points;  c  Determination of the thickness of materials;  d  Test-result interpretation; and  e  Design of the system to react properly to movement and  deflection.  

# AC03 - 1.3  Quality assurance  

The Contractor shall provide and install the CONCESSION SIGN  BAND, CONCESSION OVAL SIGN and ALUMINIUM CLADDING for  Concession Shopfronts including framing and other accessories, that  have been designed to the extent stated herein, produced, fabricated  and installed to withstand the loadings as specified herein, without

AC10 - 7.1.1  Prior to the commencement of Work, the Contractor shall construct a  testing prototype with following requirements:  

a  A full width and sized set of duplex proprietary Flood Boards as  shown on the Drawings.  b  Two full size proprietary FIXED WALL POST and one  REMOVABLE LOCKING POST as shown on the Drawings.  c  A water holding tank to simulate the expected depth of water  during flood conditions.  The tank dimensions shall be no less  than the height of the Flood Boards x width of the Flood Boards   $\times\mathrm{~}\%$   depth of the Flood Boards (Min. 1m) to simulate external  flooding conditions. Line the tank with a membrane sufficient to  maintain the water level for a minimum of 4 hours. The system  shall be capable to hold back flood waters for a period of 2  hours without allowing more than 5 litres / minute of water to  pass through the panel edges.  

AC10 - 7.1.2  Test the prototype by filling the tank to within 50mm of the top of the  Flood Boards and holding the water there for a period of 4 hours.   Monitor and maintain water at that level for the entire period.   Observe the panel edges and look for water leakage. Measure water  leakage per minute based on the amount of water being added in the  tank to maintain the level. Leakage in excess of the performance  criteria will constitute a failure of the test.  

# Section AC 10: Flood Boards  

AC10 - 7.1.3  Adjust the design of flood board edges and GASKET until a  successful test is achieved.  If panels deflect excessively, then  redesign and re-fabricate panels with increased rigidity.

# AC12 - 1.2  Design responsibility  

The Engineer has designed the systems in overall layout, section  and interface with other elements of the Works. The Contractor shall  complete the design of the systems including making adequate  provision to withstand the specified loads at all details, intersections,  connections and laps, fixings to the structural supports, and fixings  for other elements. Hoardings, Covered Walkways and Barriers shall  be designed with bolt and nut connections that are able to be  removed and reused at other parts of the project or for future projects  to avoid material wastage.  

In this regard the Contractor shall engage a Hong Kong Registered  Professional  Engineer,  who  is  experienced  in  providing  comprehensive engineering analysis to show the completed systems'  compliance with specified requirements. Scope of this service would  include: Sizing of framing members, determination of the size and  locations of fixing points, determination of the thickness of materials,  test-result interpretation, design of the system to react properly to  movement and deflection, and the like.  

# AC12 - 1.2.3  

The Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining the specified  noise level on the public side of the hoarding line. Methods of  

# Section AC 12: Hoardings, Covered Walkways and Barriers
