b) Multi-directional hairline finish – buffed with an abrasive pad  (150/180 grit) using an oscillating tool to produce a random  textured finish suitable for areas subject to heavy wear and tear,  enabling easy remedial finishing;  

c) Matte finish – blasted with crushed glass medium grit (20/40) at  90 PSI to produce a dull texture with good slip resistance;  

d) Bead blasted finish – blasted with spherical glass beads  (100/170 grit) at 50 PSI to produce a bright smooth satin finish.  

Rinse surfaces after finishing.  Remove embedded foreign matter  and leave surfaces chemically clean. Once dry, apply self-adhesive  plastic film to protect the surfaces during transportation.  

# GS03 - 5.8  Surface preparation for SS (SS316 and SS304) to receive paint  

After surfaces have been finished to the proper texture and  smoothness, thoroughly clean surfaces as recommended by the  coating manufacturer using EPOXY PAINT solvent to remove oil,  oxidation, and other contaminants that might interfere with coating  adhesion.  As indicated in the Drawings, etch away the top layer of the  metal to the appropriate depth by using an acid solution or by creating  a matte finish (blasted with crushed glass) as recommended by the  EPOXY PAINT manufacturer.

GS06 - 5.9.1  Mixing  

The base and hardener components shall be individually stirred to re- disperse any settlement.  The base and hardener shall be mixed  together until a uniform grey paste is obtained.  The filler should then  be incorporated by using a slow speed drill and paddle.  

GS06 - 5.9.2  Application  

The joints and surfaces shall be clean, dry and free from grease and  dust. Before grouting, rake out joints uniformly and clean thoroughly.  The bedding mortar shall be fully hardened.  

Apply EPOXY GROUT over the joints of tiled surface and strike off  diagonally with a plastic or hard rubber towel, ensuring grout is  worked well to fully fill up the joints.  

Use the following method to clean up excessive grout or otherwise  follow the cleaning method as recommended by the grout  manufacturer: -  

a  Give first wash with warm water and a suitable hard sponge  rubbing with circular motion. Rinse out sponge frequently.   b  Then wash with a soft sponge, rinsing out sponge well.  c  After a minimum of two and maximum of five hours after  grouting, give final wash by removing the remaining haze from  tiles with a clean and damp soft cloth.  d  Cleaning after 24 hours of grouting cannot be carried out  effectively. The Contractor is required to carefully inspect the  final cleaning result to ensure that any invisible translucent film  of the uncured material is completely removed or otherwise  there is risk of soiling when exposed to use. The Contractor  shall then propose method for removing soiling for agreement  with the Engineer and bear all the associated cost for making  good.  

GS06 - 5.9.3  Limitations  

Application shall not commence if the temperature is below   $5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   or if  the application surface is affected with either frost or ice.  The epoxy  grout should not be applied to damp or wet surfaces nor should it be  exposed to moving water during application.
