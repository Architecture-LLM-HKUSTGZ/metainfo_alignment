# Falsework  

(1) The design of falsework shall be carried out in  accordance with BS 5975 and shall demonstrate that it  includes full allowance for all dead, environmental  (wind, temperature and earthquake, as appropriate),  and applied loads.  The latter shall include an  allowance for vertical loading on all parts of the  falsework, for access and working conditions, which  shall not be less than   $1.5\,\mathsf{k N m}^{2}$  .  Where heavy items  of plant are used or materials stored on the falsework  or on the completed structure before it becomes  self-supporting, this allowance shall be increased.   The drawings shall be clearly marked with the  maximum safe limit for loading of the falsework from  items of plant or materials.  

(2) The falsework shall be designed to sustain the  following horizontal loading, which may act  transversely or longitudinally, separately or  simultaneously:  

(a) dynamic pressure head due to a wind speed of  44 m/sec;  (b) horizontal loads arising from the unintentional  non-verticality of vertical load carrying members.  These shall be calculated in each of the following  cases as a percentage of the vertical load, acting  as a horizontal force at the point of contact  between the vertical load and the supporting  falsework:  (i)  props or tubes up to 10 in number :  $2.5\%$   of  the vertical load;    (ii)  props or tubes more than 10 in number :   $1.0\%$   of the vertical load;    (iii)  self braced scaffold systems :   $1.0\%$   of the  vertical load;  (iv)  trishore supports :   $1.0\%$   of the vertical load;  

(v)  structural steel supports & trestling :   $0.5\%$  of the vertical load  

(c)  The effect of loss of support or lack of fit,  particularly in systems with low redundancy;  

(d) horizontal forces derived from impulse and  impacts upon or attachments to the falsework,  unbalanced horizontal forces derived from the  application of vertical loads to non-vertical  surfaces, movements of the falsework due to  temperature, creep, shrinkage, settlement,  post-tensioning operations, external ties and  anchorages.  

(3) The design of the falsework shall ensure that the  falsework receives the loads from, and maintains in  the required position, elements of the Permanent  Works until they become self supporting.  Facilities  shall be provided for compensating for temporary  works deflections, the order of magnitude of which  shall be calculated by the Contractor and consented to  by the Engineer prior to construction commencing.  

(4) Falsework erected close to traffic shall be protected by  crash barriers against impact from vehicles.  These  shall be capable of sustaining the load from a 1.5  tonnes vehicle striking the barrier at 110 km/hour and  at an angle of  $\mathcal{Z}0^{\circ}$   without permitting the vehicle or  barriers to come into contact with any part of the  falsework, or as agreed with the Highways  Department.  

(5) Foundations for falsework shall be designed to sustain  the calculated maximum loads without failure or  unacceptable settlement.  The calculations shall by  reference to soil data or tests demonstrate the validity  of assumptions made in respect of permissible  settlements and earth pressures under falsework  foundations.  

(6) All materials used as load carrying elements in the  falsework shall conform to the relevant British  Standards in respect of quality, and the design shall  use the allowable stresses in those standards.   Materials not conforming with the relevant British  Standard may be used, but only if the yield stress can  be established, in which case the allowable stress  shall be calculated by applying the same partial safety  factors on that yield stress as used in the relevant  British Standard.  

(7) A minimum factor of safety of 1.2 is required against  instability of the falsework under any combination of  vertical and horizontal loads.  

(8) Testing of materials or components may be ordered by  the Engineer where their quality or adequacy is in  doubt.  As far as possible, such test shall conform to  the appropriate British Standards or shall be as stated  in the Materials and Workmanship Specification.  

(9) Where materials are re-used, factored stresses shall  be reduced to suit the condition of the material.  This  shall generally be achieved by considering a reduction  in the size of section.  

Compressed Air    2.23  Retaining  Installations  

(1) Compressed air retaining installations, such as  bulkheads and locks, shall be designed to withstand a  pressure of 1.3 times the anticipated maximum  working air pressure, up to a limit of the maximum  output pressure of the compressed air plant, less 0.1  bar allowance for air loss.  For the design of concrete  retaining installations, the design pressure shall be 1.3  times the maximum working air pressure multiplied by  the standard imposed load factor.  

(2) Compressed air installations shall be designed for a  working air pressure to counterbalance the maximum  hydrostatic head along the tunnel.

# SECTION 3  

# SHAFT AND TUNNEL WORKS  

General  

# Introduction  

(1) This Section specifies materials and workmanship  required for tunnels and shafts including cut and cover  tunnels and immersed tube tunnels, bored tunnels  and drill and blast tunnels. 

  

 (2) All reference in this Section to tunnel or tunnels is  deemed to equally apply to shafts and caverns,  except Clause 3.1(3) below which is applicable to  tunnels only.  

(3) To prevent concrete spalling during a tunnel fire, all  tunnel concrete lining shall be provided with  polypropylene fibres.  The fibres shall be 6-12mm  long and   $18{\cdot}32\upmu\mathrm{m}$   in diameter, and shall have a  melting point less than   $180^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  .  A lower dosage  may be adopted subject to fire test in accordance  with BS 476-20.  Generally, 1kg of polypropylene  fibres shall be added to   $1\mathsf{m}^{3}$  of concrete.  The exact  quantity of polypropylene fibres to be used shall be  approved by the Engineer and Building Authority.  Polypropylene fibres shall conform to BS EN 14889  Part 2 and be mixed by mechanical means.  The  mixing of polypropylene fibres should be carried out  by a QSPSC batching plant.  

(4) The Contractor is required to provide justification to  the dosage and size of the polypropylene fibre in  terms of workability and performance against spalling  of concrete surface upon satisfaction to the Engineer.

Mechanical rock bolts, resin or cement grouted  tensioned/untensioned rock bolts, grouted  dowels and ground anchors are typical  examples of rock reinforcement.  

(f)  "Rock Support" shall mean a supporting  element that does not form part of the  reinforced rock mass and provides support to  the rock mass by pre-supporting or responding  to inward movement of the excavation.  Shotcrete, mesh, lattice arch girders are typical  examples of rock support.  

(2) The terminology for the various loads on rock  reinforcement shall be defined as follows:  

(a)  "Working load" shall be defined as the load  which the rock reinforcement is designed to  sustain during its working life.  

(b)  "Tension load" shall be defined as the preload  applied to a two stage rock reinforcement which  provides a positive load to the rock mass and  which shall be maintained after any initial load  loss in the reinforcement.  This will normally be  a proportion of the working load.  

(c)  "Lock off load" shall be defined as the tension  preload applied to a two stage rock  reinforcement before the head bolts are  tightened or locked which is the specified  tension preload plus an allowance for load loss  determined by the site trials.

# Description  

# Type of Stone Backfill  

# Fill Material  

# Method of  Treatment  

# Treatment  Technique  

suitable identifiable pins or markers.   

 4.15  The Contractor shall provide and maintain bench marks  throughout the duration of the ground treatment works.   

 4.16  All ground treatment points shall be located to the  tolerances given in the Particular Specification.   

   Stone Columns   

 4.17  Ground treatment by forming stone columns shall be carried  out by deep vibratory compaction incorporating stone  columns formed with imported granular backfill.   

 4.18  Stone used to form the columns shall be clean, hard, inert  material and shall be natural sand, gravel, crushed rock,  crushed hardcore or crushed slag.  The material shall be  suitable for the ground conditions in which the stone  columns are formed and have no adverse effects on other  work on the site.  Grading shall be a nominal single-size  material within the range 20 to 75mm or graded material  complying with the grading for sub-base as given in Section  15 of this Specification.  For graded materials any material  passing the BS 425μm sieve shall be non-plastic.   

 4.19  The material used by the Contractor for filling to make up  ground levels to the working surface prior to treatment shall  be uniformly graded hard inert granular material capable of  passing a BS 106mm sieve with not more than   $10\%$    passing the BS 75μm sieve.   

 4.20  Treatment may be by either the wet or dry process.  If the  dry process is used it shall be demonstrated on site that the  hole made by the Contractor's plant will remain open to  enable the stone to be placed cleanly to the bottom of the  hole to form a continuous column of the specified stone to  the surface.  Where a change in the method of treatment is  required by the Contractor, prior approval of the Engineer  shall be sought without delay.   

 4.21  When the dry process is being used the vibrator may be  removed completely from the hole to allow access for the  stone.  When the wet process is being used the vibrator  shall be kept in the hole at all times in order to maintain  stability of the hole sides and to ensure that the stone shall  reach the required depth via the annular space around the  vibrator.

(2) Before installation, the Contractor shall clean and  clear the pipeline thoroughly and remove all loose  material, deposits and obstructions that may affect  the proper installation of the lining.  

(3) After cleaning the surfaces of the pipeline and before  installation of the lining, a CCTV confirmatory survey  shall be carried out as required.  All pertinent  information such as the position, size and angle of  approach of all lateral connections shall be recorded  and logged.  The Contractor shall submit a sample  log sheet to the Engineer for approval.  On  completion of installation of lining and before  re-commissioning the pipeline, a CCTV  post-installation survey shall be carried out.  The  Contractor shall provide two copies of a video record  of the CCTV confirmatory survey and the  post-installation survey, where required to be carried  out, and two copies of log sheets to the Engineer  within 2 working days of completion of the lining  works.  

(4) The method of installation shall follow the  manufacturer’s recommendations, or shall be  approved by the Engineer.  The Contractor shall  produce a smooth, corrosion-resistant and durable  internal lining of adequate strength with its outer  surface in close and firm contact with the pipeline  interior after completing the installation.

The wall thickness shall be determined at a minimum  of 5 locations.  The measuring device shall be  accurate to  $\pm\:0.1\mathsf{m m}$  .  The wall thickness at all  points shall be not less than the specified design  thickness and may be up to   $15\%$   greater.  

The  $90\%$   lower confidence limits of short term  flexural modulus   $\mathsf{E}_{\mathsf{0}}$  , flexural stress at first break σ b and flexural strain at first break ε b  shall be not less  than the respective design values declared by the  supplier.  

If any result of the above tests on flexural properties  of the samples fails to meet the acceptance criteria,  the Contractor shall carry out test on samples taken  from the finished lining to determine the creep  modulus in accordance with BS EN ISO 11296-4  Annex C for validation against the manufacturer’s  creep data.  

If any wall thickness determined in the sample  testing fails to meet the design thickness but the  result of tests on flexural properties is up to the  acceptance criteria, the actual wall thickness  measured on finished lining shall not be less than the  design thickness.  

(3) For in-situ internal sleeve lining, the Contractor shall,  in addition to other tests specified in this clause, also  test the repaired location for leakage by a proprietary  joint tester according to the testing procedures  recommended by the manufacturer and approved by  the Engineer.  The test results shall satisfy the  compliance criteria equivalent to those stated in  Clause 5.104 (for gravity pipelines) or Clause 5.107  (for pressure pipelines).  

(4) For other types of lining, they shall be sampled and  tested according to internationally recognised  specifications and their manufacturer’s  specifications, and/or as specified by the Engineer as  a condition of approval in accordance with  sub-clause (1) of Clause 5.112.  

(5) If the result of any performance test on the samples  fails to meet the compliance criteria, the Engineer  may instruct that the test be repeated on samples  taken from the finished lining for validation against  the manufacturer’s data.  The number of samples of  the finished lining to be taken and the positions of  taking samples shall be determined by the Engineer.  

(6) The Contractor shall propose 3 laboratories capable  of carrying out the required tests for selection and  approval by the Engineer.  The Engineer shall  select one laboratory for testing and one laboratory  as backup in case the performance of the selected  laboratory is unsatisfactory.  As required by the  Engineer, the Contractor shall provide assistance in  delivering the samples to the approved laboratory for  carrying out the performance tests based on the  Contractor’s approved testing proposal.  Test  reports and the tested samples shall be sent to the  Engineer directly by the approved laboratory.  

(7) The maximum number of samples which may be  ordered by the Engineer for each type of  performance test shall be one per 50m of lined  pipe/culvert.

# Procedure:   Before Tests and  Inspections  

# Procedure:        Water Test  

5.4.3  The procedure before tests and inspections shall be as  follows:  

(1)  Debris and water shall be removed from the pipeline.    (2)  Openings to the pipeline shall be sealed using  expanding disc stoppers, air bags or other methods  approved by the Engineer and secured against  movement.  

5.4.4  The procedure for the water test shall be as follows:  

(1)  The pipeline shall be filled with water and shall remain  filled for 2 hours before testing starts to allow  absorption to take place.    (2)  A test pressure of   $1.2\,{\mathsf{m}}$   head of water above the  soffit of the pipe at the high end shall be applied at the  standpipe and maintained for 30 minutes; the test  pressure applied shall not exceed 5m and  $6\,\mathsf{m}$   head  of water at the invert of the low end of the pipe for PE  pipeline and other pipeline respectively.  

(3)  The head of water at the standpipe shall be topped up  at 5 minute intervals during the test and shall be filled  to the specified head at the end of the test period by  adding measured quantities of water to the standpipe.  

(4)  The leakage of water from the pipeline shall be  measured as the amount of water added to maintain  the specified test pressure.  

# Air Test  

5.4.5  The procedure for the air test shall be as follows:  

(1)  Air shall be pumped into the pipeline until a test  pressure of slightly more than   $100\:\mathsf{m m}$   of water is  registered on an U-tube manometer connected to the  pipeline.  5 minutes shall be allowed for stabilisation  of the air temperature and the air pressure shall then  be adjusted to   $100\:\mathsf{m m}$   of water. 

  

 (2)  The pressure shall be read from the U-tube at the end  of a 5 minutes period without further pumping.  

# Procedure:          Visual Inspection  

# Procedure:          Infiltration Test  

5.4.6  The inside of the pipeline shall be inspected visually and  infiltration or damage to pipes or joints shall be recorded.  

5.4.7  The procedure for the infiltration test shall be as follows:  

After the completion of backfilling and stabilization of ground  water level, the sewer should be checked for infiltration.  All  live inlets should be sealed and the line inspected from the  manholes.  Any flow from the pipeline coming into the  manholes or within the manholes themselves should be  investigated to establish its source. In small pipes the point  of infiltration may be located visually with light and mirror or  with an inflated rubber plug. When conditions justify it a  video camera can be used.  

The sewer may normally be acceptable if the infiltration  does not exceed 1 litre per hour per metre diameter per  metre of pipe run, although this will depend on the judgment  of the Engineer and the extent of exfiltration shown by the  water test.  

# Calculation  

5.4.8  The permitted leakage of water from, or infiltration into the  pipeline during the water or infiltration test shall be  calculated from the equation:  

t   litre  Permitted leakage/infiltration = d x l x                                 60  where:  

–   d is the nominal diameter of the pipe (m), 

 –   l is the length of pipeline tested (m), 

 –   t is the test period (min).

Thrust and anchor blocks, pipe straps and  other devices required to prevent movement of pipes  and fittings shall be completed before testing starts. 

  

 (4)  The pipeline shall be filled with water and all air shall  be removed; measures shall be taken during filling to  provide free outlets for air and to prevent water  hammer.  

# Calculation  

(5)  The pressure in the pipeline shall be increased to  working pressure and the pipeline shall remain filled  at this pressure for 2 hours to allow absorption to take  place and to achieve conditions which are as stable  as practicable. 

  

 (6)  The pressure in the pipeline shall be increased slowly  by pumping water into the pipeline using a force  pump until the specified test pressure is reached at  the lowest part of the pipeline being tested.

 (9)  The pipeline shall be left in this condition for a test  period of 1 hour; no water shall be allowed to enter  the pipeline during the test period. 

  

 (10) At the end of the test period the pressure in the  pipeline shall be recorded. 

  

 (11) The pumps and water supply points shall be  reconnected and the pressure shall be increased to  the specified test pressure. 

  

 (12) Water shall be drawn off from the pipeline until the  pressure in the pipeline is the same as at the end of  the test period.  The leakage of water from the  pipeline shall be measured as the amount of water  drawn off. 

  

 (1)    The average test pressure (P) shall be calculated as  the average of the specified test pressure and the  pressure at the end of the test period. 

  

 (2)  The permitted leakage of water from the pipeline  during the pressure test shall be calculated from the  equation:   t     litre  

Permitted leakage  $=$   d x l x    x P

                          12  

–  d is the nominal diameter of the pipe (m),

 (2) The permission of the Engineer shall be obtained  before the next layer is deposited on each layer of  compacted fill material. 

  

 (3) Except as stated in Clauses6.29(4), 6.31(2), 6.34(2)  and 6.37, fill material shall be compacted to at least   $95\%$   of the Maximum Dry Density measured in  accordance with Geospec 3, Test Method 10.1, 10.2,  10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7 or 10.8 throughout unless  otherwise stated in the Contract. 

  

 (4)    For general fill material of which less than  $90\%$    passes a   $\sf{20~m m}$   BS test sieve, it is difficult to  determine of the moisture content and maximum dry  density.  This type of material shall be compacted to  the requirements of Clauses 6.29(5), 6.29(6) and  6.29(7). 

  

 (5)  Each horizontal layer of general fill material shall be  spread and levelled with a thickness not less than  1.5 times of the maximum size of the general fill  material and not exceeding the maximum depth of  compacted layer in accordance with Table 6.2.  If  there is a presence of over-sized coarse material in  the general fill, the over-sized coarse material shall  be removed or broken down to sizes acceptable to  the Engineer.  Each layer shall be systematically  compacted by a vibratory roller with the stipulated  minimum number of passes corresponding to the  minimum static load per   $100\:\mathsf{m m}$   width of the roller.  

(6)  The number of passes of the roller shall only be  counted when the roller is travelled on the material to  be compacted at a speed of not more than 2 km per  hour with full vibration.  Plant other than a vibratory  roller carrying out material spreading or providing  some preliminary compaction, to assist the use of  heavier plant, shall be disregarded in counting the  number of passes.  

(7)  Variation from the method or the use of plant  different from that specified in Clause 6.29(5) will be  permitted only if the Contractor demonstrates at site  trials that equivalent compaction is achieved by the  alternative method or plant.  The procedure to be  adopted for these site trials shall be agreed with and  approved by the Engineer.  

(8)  Without prejudice to the provision of the Conditions  of Contract and in order that the Engineer may take  proper provision for the supervision of compaction in  the permanent work, the Contractor shall, not less  than 24 hours before he proposes to carry out  compaction processes, apply in writing to the  Engineer for permission to do so.  

(9) When materials of widely divergent grading are used  in embankments and fill areas, they shall be spread  and compacted in separate clearly defined areas.  

(10) If more than one class of material is being used in  such a way that in the opinion of the Engineer, it is  not practicable to define the areas in which each  class occurs, compaction plant shall be operated as  if only the material that requires the greatest  compaction effort is being compacted.

The  device shall have a nominal diameter which exceeds  the probe diameter by not more than 3 mm and shall  be graduated to indicate the depth of the hole.  The  device shall have a guide which will ensure that the  hole is formed normal to the prepared surface.  

Procedure:  Comparability of  Test Methods  

Procedure:   Routine   Densometer   Check  

(5)  Sampling equipment, such as augers, spades, picks,  small digging tools, scoops, airtight containers and  bags, to obtain samples of the material.    (6)  Apparatus for the determination of the moisture  content in accordance with either Geospec 3, Test  Method 5.1 and 5.2 or Appendix 6.2 or Appendix 6.6.    (1)    Before using the densometer on material for which it  has not previously been used, the results of  determinations of in-situ bulk density using the  densometer shall be compared with the results of  determinations of in-situ bulk density in accordance  with Geospec 3, Method 11.2.  The location of each  determination in accordance with Geospec 3, Method  11.2shall correspond to the midpoint of the  densometer probe and the gamma sensor.  A  minimum of 10 pairs of determinations shall be  carried out.    (2)  If the difference between any pair of results does not  exceed   $0.08\mathsf{M g}/\mathsf{m}^{3}$   and if the densometer produces  results which are both higher and lower than those  produced in accordance withGeospec 3, Method  11.2, the densometer may be used without correction.    (3)  If either of the criteria stated in Clause 6.3.3(2) is not  met, the densometer shall not be used.  

6.3.4  The procedure for carrying out a routine densometer check  shall be as follows:  

(1)  The densometer shall be warmed up in accordance  with the manufacturer's recommendations.  

(2)  A standard count shall be carried out in accordance  with the manufacturer's recommendations.  The  standard count shall be carried out by placing the  reference standard on a hard, level surface consisting  of material with a density of at least   $1600\,\,{\sf k}/{\sf m}^{3}$  .  The  reference standard shall be placed at a distance of at  least   $10\,{\sf m}$   from any other nuclear device and at least   $3\,\mathsf{m}$   from any large object.  At least 3 count readings  shall be taken and the mean of the 3 readings shall  be determined.  The mean shall be the standard  count reading for the day.  

(3)  The standard count reading for the day shall be  compared with the mean of the standard count  readings for the previous 4 days.  If the difference is  greater than recommended by the manufacturer or if  no recommendation is made and the difference is  greater than   $1\%$  , the densometer shall not be used.  

(4)  The densometer shall be left switched on with the  probe in the locked position.  If the densometer is  switched off a further standard count shall be carried  out in accordance with Clause 6.3.4(2) and (3).  

# Procedure:  Determination   of In-Situ  Bulk Density  

6.3.5  The procedure for determination of the in-situ bulk density  shall be as follows:  

(1)  A level surface of sufficient size to accommodate the  densometer shall be prepared and cleared of all  disturbed and loose material.  The depth of any  depression below the densometer shall not exceed 3  mm.  Depressions exceeding 3 mm in depth shall be  filled using fine sand or material taken from the  adjacent soil which passes a   $600\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$   BS test sieve.    (2)  A suitable hole for the probe shall be prepared using  the hole forming device.  The hole shall be normal to  the prepared test area and at least  $50\:\mathsf{m m}$   deeper  than the intended test depth.  If a driven pin is used  to form the hole, the pin shall be rotated every 2 or 3  blows to facilitate its removal.    (3)  The test depth shall be the same as the maximum  depth required for determination of the in-situ bulk  density in accordance with Geospec 3, Test Method  11.1 and 11.2as appropriate to the grain size of the  material.    (4)  The probe shall be positioned and inserted into the  hole in such a manner that the gamma source is  shielded at all times.  The probe shall be seated  firmly against the side of the hole nearest to the back  of the densometer by gently pulling the densometer  backwards until contact is achieved.  The operator  shall ensure that the densometer is correctly seated  and the depth setting on the control panel is the same  as the probe depth.    (5)  The operator shall ensure that there are no other  radioactive sources within   $10\;\mathsf{m}$   of the densometer.  

(6)  Three readings of the in-situ bulk density shall be  

taken in accordance with the manufacturer's  recommendations and the mean determined.  If any  one reading differs from any other reading by more  than   $0.015\,\mathsf{M g}/\mathsf{m}^{3}$  , additional readings shall be taken  until 3 consecutive readings which do not differ by  more than   $0.015\,\mathsf{M g}/\mathsf{m}^{3}$   are obtained and the mean  determined.  The mean of the 3 readings shall be  taken as the in-situ bulk density (IBD).  If the above  criterion is not met after 6 readings, the densometer  shall not be used.  

(7)  The densometer shall be removed and a minimum  500 g sample of the material directly beneath the  densometer position shall be taken for determination  of the moisture content.  The sample shall be  obtained by augering or digging to the test depth.   The sample shall be placed in a moisture tight  container and the lid replaced.  The moisture content   $(\mathsf{w})$   shall be determined in accordance with either  Geospec 3, Test Method 5.1 or 5.2, or Appendix 6.2  or Appendix 6.6.  

(8)  If a sample of material at the same location as the  densometer test is required for determination of the  maximum dry density or the maximum converted bulk  density, the sample shall be obtained by digging to  the test depth, keeping the sides of the excavation  vertical and the bottom flat and level.  The  appropriate quantity of material required for the test  shall be taken, placed in a moisture tight container  and the container sealed.  

# Calculation  

6.3.6  The in-situ dry density of the material (IDD) shall be  calculated from the equation:

The sample shall be obtained  by digging to the same depth as that of the in-situ  bulk density test, keeping the sides of the excavation  vertical and the bottom flat and level.  The size of the  sample shall be sufficient to yield a minimum of   $10\,{\sf k g}$    after screening over a 20mm BS test sieve.  (2)  The sample shall be weighed to the nearest 0.01 g.  (3)  The sample shall be screened over a  $\sf{20}\,\sf{m m}$   BS test  sieve, ensuring that moisture loss is kept to a  minimum and that any free moisture appearing in the  containers is worked back into the sample.  (4)  The amount retained on the sieve shall be weighed to  the nearest 0.01 g and expressed as a percentage of  the mass of the sample.  If the percentage exceeds   $5\%$  , an adjustment for coarse material shall be made  in accordance with Appendix 6.5.  If the percentage  does not exceed   $5\%$  , an adjustment is not required.  

(5)  The material to be tested shall be thoroughly mixed  and divided by quartering or by using a riffle box to  obtain a minimum of 4 specimens of at least   $2500\,\mathfrak{g}$    each, ensuring that moisture loss is kept to a  minimum.  Alternatively, if it has previously been  ascertained that the material is not susceptible to  crushing, a single specimen of at least 2500 g may be  used for repeat testing.  

(6)  Each specimen shall be weighed to the nearest 0.01g  and the result shall be taken as the mass of the  specimen at the in-situ moisture content.  

(7)  Each specimen and any remaining material shall be  placed in separate moisture tight containers and the  containers sealed.  

(8)  The converted bulk density of at least 3 specimens  shall be plotted against the amount of water added or  removed as a percentage of the mass of the  specimen at the in-situ moisture content (z) on a  graph in accordance with the procedure stated in  Clause 6.4.3(9) to (15).  

(9)  The first point on the graph shall be obtained as  follows:  

(a)  The first point on the graph shall be obtained  as follows:   -  A specimen shall be compacted at its  in-situ moisture content in accordance  with Geospec 3, Test Method 10.1, clause  10.1.5 or Test Method 10.2, clause 10.2.5  whichever as directed by the Engineer.     -  A diametrical slice of approximately   $400~\mathfrak{g}$  to 500 g shall be cut from the specimen  along its entire length. The in-situ moisture  content  of  the  slice  (w i )  shall  be  determined in accordance with either  Geospec 3, Test Method 5.1 or 5.2 or  Appendix 6.2 or Appendix 6.6 whichever  as directed by the Engineer.

(b)  Not used  

(10) The second point on the graph shall be obtained as  follows:  

the in-situ moisture content obviously exceeds  the optimum moisture content, the procedure  stated in Clause 6.4.3(k) shall be followed;    (b) The moisture content of the specimen shall be  increased by adding an amount of water equal  to   ${\mathcal{Z}}^{\%}$   of the mass of the specimen.  The  specimen shall be thoroughly mixed and  compacted in accordance with the method  stipulated in Clause 6.4.3 (i);    (c)  The bulk density   $(\mathsf{B}\mathsf{D}_{2})$   shall be calculated as  stated in Clause 6.4.4(1), adjusted to converted  bulk density (CBD 2 ) as stated in Clause 6.4.4(2)  and plotted on the   $+\mathcal{E}\%$   ordinate of the graph.  

(11) If the in-situ moisture content of the second specimen  obviously exceeds the optimum moisture content, the  specimen shall be dried until the amount of water  removed is approximately  ${\mathcal{Z}}^{\%}$   of the mass of the  specimen after cooling.  The specimen shall be  thoroughly mixed and compacted in accordance with  the method stipulated in Clause 6.4.3 (i).  The  amount of water removed shall be determined.

(12) The third point on the graph shall be obtained as  follows:  

(a) If the plotted value of   $\mathsf{C B D}_{2}$   is equal to or greater  than the plotted value of CBD 1 , the moisture  content of a third specimen shall be increased  by adding an amount of water equal to   $4\%$   of the  mass of the specimen.  Alternatively, if the  procedure stated in Clause 6.4.3(k) has been  followed, the specimen shall be dried until the  amount of water removed is approximately   $4\%$  of the mass of the specimen after cooling.  

(b) If the plotted value of   $\mathsf{C B D}_{2}$   is less than the  plotted value of   ${\mathsf{C B D}}_{1}$  , the third specimen shall  be dried until the amount of water removed is  approximately   ${\mathcal{Z}}^{\%}$   of the mass of the specimen  after cooling.

(c)  The specimen shall be thoroughly mixed and  compacted in accordance with the method  stipulated in Clause 6.4.3 (i).  The amount of  water removed shall be determined.  

(d) The bulk density (BD 3 ) shall be calculated as  stated in Clause 6.4.4(1), adjusted to converted  bulk density (CBD 3 ) as stated in Clause 6.4.4.(2)  and plotted on the graph at a point which  corresponds to the amount of water added or  removed.  

(13) If the centre point of the 3 points plotted is lower than  one of the other 2 points, or is higher than one point  and equal to the other, an additional point or points  shall be obtained by proceeding in   ${\mathcal{Z}}^{\%}$   increments or  decrements as appropriate.  

(14) If it is apparent that the moisture condition of the  material is such that a total of 5 points will not result in  the determination of the optimum moisture content,  increments and decrements of  $3\%$   may be adopted  for the entire procedure.  

(15) A smooth approximately parabolic curve shall be  drawn to the plotted points.  The peak value of the  curve shall be determined as the maximum converted  bulk density (MCBD).

# Apparatus  

(1)  An infrared oven with a suitable power control device  and ventilation capable of maintaining control test  specimen with temperature at   $105\pm5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and test  specimens for calibration the performance of infrared  oven with temperature not exceeding   $110^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  .  Control  test specimen should be sand in size of   $63\upmu\mathrm{m}$   to   $600\upmu\mathrm{m}$   and first dried in accordance with Geospec 3,  Test Method 5.1 or 5.2.  Test specimens for  calibrating the performance of the infrared oven  should have particle size distribution with the range  as stated in Table 6.6.1 and have a minimum  moisture content of optimum moisture content plus   $3\%$  .  The difference of mass of the test specimens  taken in 3 hours and 3.5 hours after drying in the  infrared oven should be less than   $0.1\%$   of the original  wet mass of the test specimens.  

(2)  Suitable glass containers with lids.  A balance readable to 0.01g and accurate to 0.05g.  

# Procedure  

6.6.3  The procedure shall be as follows:  

(1)  The container and its lid shall be cleaned, dried and  weighed to the nearest 0.01g (m 1 ). 

  

 (2)  A test specimen shall be crumbled and placed loosely  in the container. The mass of soil required for the  preparation of a test specimen shall be at least 300g  and in no case be greater than 350g. 

  

 (3)  The container and contents together with its lid on  shall be weighed to the nearest 0.01g (m 2 ). 

  

 (4)  The lid of the container shall be removed and the  container with its contents shall be placed in the  infrared oven and dried. 

  

 (5)  After an initial drying period of 3 hours, the lid shall be  replaced and the container and contents shall be  weighed to the nearest 0.01 g. 

  

 (6)  The lid of the container shall be removed and the  container with its contents shall be placed back in the  infrared oven for successive drying of half an hour.  

  

 (7)  The lid shall be replaced and the container and  contents shall be weighed to the nearest 0.01 g. 

  

 (8)  The test specimen shall be considered to be dry when  the difference between the mass readings taken 3  hours and 3.5 hours after drying is less than   $0.1\%$   of  the original wet mass of the test specimen. In case  the drying criterion is not satisfied, the test specimen  shall be transferred to convection oven to continue  drying in accordance with Geospect 3, Test Method  5.2.  Alternatively, the test specimen may be  returned to the infrared drying oven for successive  drying until the drying criterion is satisfied or for one  or more cycles of drying before transferring to the  convection oven as specified, if no abnormality is  identified.  In this case, the test specimen shall be  successively weighed at 0.5 hour intervals and the  specimen shall be considered to be dry when the  difference between two consecutive mass readings is  less than   $0.1\ \%$   of the original wet mass.  

(9)  The final mass of the container, its lid and contents  shall be weighed to the nearest 0.01 g (m 3 ) when the  test specimen is dried.  

# Calculation  

6.6.4  The moisture content of the test specimen   $(\mathsf{w})$   shall be  calculated as a percentage of the dry soil mass to the  nearest   $0.1\%$   from the equation:  

$$
\mathsf{W}=(\mathsf{m}_{2}\!\!-\!\!\mathsf{m}_{3})/(\mathsf{m}_{3}\!\!-\!\!\mathsf{m}_{1})\times100\%
$$  

where:  

-  m 1  is the mass of container and its lid (g) 

  

 -  m 2  is the mass of the container and contents  before drying (g) 

  

 -  m 3  is the mass of container, its lid and contents  after drying (g)  

# Reporting of  Results  

6.6.5  The following shall be reported:  

(1)  The source and identification of the test specimen.    (2)  The moisture content of the test specimen to the  nearest  $0.1\%$  .

(5) At all construction joints the surface shall be  roughened to expose the aggregate, care being taken  to avoid damaging the aggregate, water bar and the  arris of the joint.  Wherever possible laitance and all  loose material shall be removed whilst the concrete is  still green.  Where this is not possible, it shall be  removed by approved mechanical means provided  that the concrete has been in position for more than 24  hours.  The roughened surface shall then be washed  with clean potable water and all loose material  removed.  

8.25  (1) In columns the horizontal joint shall normally be made  at the underside of the floor members or a few  centimetres above floor level.  Haunches and column  flares shall be considered as part of and continuous  with the floor or roof.  In walls the joint shall normally  be above splays or openings.  

(2) Whether the construction joint is sloping or horizontal,  continuous keys shall be provided to give a  satisfactory shear strength.  Keys shall be sunk and  shall have a width at the surface of the concrete equal  to one third of the overall width of the pour.  The keys  shall be tapered about 1 in 4 on each face for easy  removal and shall have a depth equal to one half of  the width of the key at the concrete face with a  minimum of   $50\:\mathsf{m m}$  .  The reinforcement shall normally  continue through the joint.

The concrete shall be fully compacted  under the strip to give a neat straight line.  Should the  concrete rise more than 12 mm above the bottom of  the strip, it shall be cut back before pouring the next lift  so that no narrow shelf remains on which excess grout  from the pour may collect.  A steel angle may be used  instead of a timber strip.  

8.26  (1) Vertical construction joints shall be formed with rough  shuttering.  On removal of the shuttering the joint  shall be treated in accordance with Clauses 8.24(5).  

(2) Continuous keys shall be provided in all vertical joints  to give an adequate shear strength.  Keys shall be to  the following details unless otherwise shown on the  Drawings or approved by the Engineer.  Keys shall be  sunk and shall have a width at the surface of the  concrete equal to one third of the overall width of the  pour.  The keys shall be tapered about 1 in 4 on each  face for easy removal and shall have a depth equal to  one half of the width at the concrete face with a  minimum of   $50\:\mathsf{m m}$  .  

(3) No proprietary systems for forming construction joints  shall be used.

(2) Before the concrete of the adjacent section is placed  the approved filler material shall be firmly fixed in  position as shown on the Drawings or as approved by  the Engineer.  It shall be neatly cut round all keys and  up to waterbars.  The concreting of the adjacent  section shall be carried out with care to prevent  damage to the joint filler material.  Sufficient time shall  be allowed for the concrete to cure before the  temporary filler piece is removed to avoid any damage  to the concrete.  

# Contraction   Joints  

8.28  Contraction joints are intended to allow for the shrinkage of  concrete after pouring and are associated with restrictions  on the time allowed before the placing of adjacent concrete.   In places contraction gaps incorporating two contraction  joints are used.  All contraction joints shall be formed using  rough shuttering and shall be treated as stated in Clause  8.24(5).  Reinforcement shall normally be continued  through the joint.

(3)  The specimen shall be placed in the extrusion mould  and subjected to one application of load as stated in  Clause 8.1.3(4).  The extrusion at the open end of  the mould shall be measured to the nearest  $0.1\ \mathsf{m m}$    with the gauge or device when the specimen is  compressed to   $50\%$   of the original thickness and  before the load is released.    (1)    The recovery value (R) of each specimen shall be  calculated from the equation:     ${\sf R}={\sf t}2/{\sf t}_{1}\times100\,\%$    where:    -  t 1  is the original thickness of the specimen (mm),    -  t 2  is the thickness of the specimen after the third  application of load (mm).  

calculated from the equation:  

$\mathsf{M}=\left(\mathsf{m}_{1}\cdot\mathsf{m}_{2}\right)/\mathsf{m}_{1}\times100\%$   x 100%  where: 

  

 -   $\mathsf{m}_{1}$   is the original mass of the specimen (g), 

  

 -  m 2  is the mass of the specimen after the third  application of load (g).
