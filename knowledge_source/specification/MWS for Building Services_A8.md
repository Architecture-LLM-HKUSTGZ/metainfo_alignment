(ii) When the battery system is fully charged, the rectifier/ charger shall automatically adjust the output voltage to float charge the battery system.  

# (d) Automatic By-pass Mode (Static By-pass Switch)  

In the event of overloads exceeding system capabilities (short-circuits, heavy inrush current or battery capacity being exhausted upon rectifier/ charger supply down) or the detection of internal faults, the static by-pass switch shall instantaneously synchronize with the inverter output and transfer the critical load to the bypass supply source without load interruption.  

(ii) Retransfer of the load to the UPS shall be accomplished, after the stable restoration of the output power modules within the tolerance specified, without disturbance to the load.  

(e) Manual By-pass (Maintenance)  

(i) The external manual bypass switch shall be manually operated to perform make-before-break switching of the UPS load to either the UPS or the mains supply source without load interruption for UPS maintenance purposes. Mal-operation of the manual by-pass switch activated by either human error or equipment failure shall not cause load interruption.  

(f) Maintenance of Batteries  

(i) For maintenance purposes, it shall be possible to isolate the battery system from the rectifier/charger and the Inverter by means of a circuit breaker. In such a case, the UPS shall continue to supply the load as specified herein, except in the event of a mains supply outage.

44.1  General This Section specifies the manufacture and installation of a complete lightning protection system. The general routing of the air termination network and the locations of the earth electrodes shall be as indicated on the Drawings.

 44.2  Standards

 44.2.1  Relevant Codes and Standards

 44.2.1.1  Design and provide the whole of the lightning protection system in  accordance with the following standards:  BS EN 62305: Protection of Structures against Lightning.  BS EN 62561: Lightning Protection System Components 

 44.3  Technical and Installation Requirements 

 44.3.1  Component Parts 

 44.3.1.1  The lightning protection system shall conform to BS EN 62305 and shall  consist of the following principal component parts:  (a) air terminations, (b) down conductors, (c) joints and bonds, (d) test joints, (e) earth terminations, and (f) earth electrodes.

 44.3.2  Air Terminations 

 44.3.2.1  Air terminals shall be of taper pointed type consisting of aluminium rods  having an overall length of not less than 450mm and diameter of   $12.5\mathsf{m m}$  .   The air terminals shall be widely spaced on the highest points of the  structure and mounted on an air terminal base. The air terminals shall be  directly connected to the roof aluminium tape air termination network.   As an alternative to the pointed type rods for the air terminal, air  termination network can be formed by interconnected bare aluminium  tapes. 

 44.3.2.2  The aluminium tapes for air termination network shall have a minimum  

cross section area of   $25\mathsf{m m}$   by 3mm to BS EN 755.  

44.3.2.3  Roof tape shall take the most direct route between the air terminals and  be secured with non-ferrous fasteners spaced at 750mm intervals on  horizontal runs. 

 44.3.2.4  Radioactive air terminals will not be allowed in the protection system. 

 44.3.2.5  Early streamer emission air terminals compliance with NF C17-102 will be  allowed where specified on the Drawings.  

 44.3.2.6  Air termination for early streamer emission lightning protection system  shall be of proven job reference completed for 5 years at least. 

 44.3.2.7  The terminal shall be a passive device which uses the electric field of the  thunderstorm to collections and cause early electric arcing near the  earthed electrode. 

 44.3.2.8  The terminals, or a combination of terminals, shall be able to cover the  complete Site and at least 10m beyond the site boundary. 

 44.3.2.9  The terminal shall be mounted at least two metres above the highest  point of the structure.  The supporting mast shall be provided with  suitable surface treatment against corrosion.

Bends shall  be gradual and not less than 200mm radius. Sharp bends in the down  conductors at the edge of roofs will be permitted. However, re-entrant  loops in a conductor can produce high inductive voltage drops which  could lead to the lightning discharge jumping across the side of the loop.  To minimise this problem the length of the down conductor forming the  loop shall not exceed eight times the width of the open side of the loop.  Wherever insulated aluminium tape is specified, the aluminium tape shall  be sheathed with low smoke halogen free material unless otherwise  shown on the Drawings. 

 44.3.3.2  The down conductors shall be symmetrically installed around the outside  walls of the structure starting at the corners. Routing to avoid side- flashing shall be given particular consideration when designing and  during installation.

A standard pattern gunmetal test  clamp is required. The down conductor from the test point to earth  electrodes shall be tinned copper tapes with minimum cross section area  of 25mm x 3mm.  

44.3.5.3  No connection, other than one direct to earth electrodes, shall be made  below a testing point.  

 44.3.6  All bare copper tapes and copper tapes with oversheath shall be stamped  with “MTR” logo at regular interval to Engineer’s Approval. 

 44.3.7  Testing 

 44.3.7.1  The Contractor shall carry out tests to demonstrate to the Engineer that  the combined resistance to earth of the earth electrodes is not greater  than 10 ohms. 

 44.3.7.2  The complete lightning protection system shall be checked for correct  installation methods including the fixing and mechanical strength of:  (a) air terminations, (b) connecting tapes, (c) down conductors, and (d) test links
