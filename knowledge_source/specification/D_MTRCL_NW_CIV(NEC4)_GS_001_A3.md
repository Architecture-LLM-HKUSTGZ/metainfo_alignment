Track Related  G16.4.1  Work  

Track related work refers to work which: 

  

 (a)  is to be carried out on or adjacent to the track (including  areas in close proximity to the platform edge); 

  

 (b)  requires access to the track; or 

  

 (c)  may affect the normal operation of the train, station, depot  or railway.  

G16.4.2  Track related work is carried out under either:  

(a)  Track access (with possession) – when it is necessary to  control a specific section of track or tracks, when using  the Engineer’s train, and the possession of the track(s)  are under the sole control of the  Project Manager ’s  Person-in-charge (EPIC). The EPIC is provided by the  Project Manager ; or    (b)  Track access (without possession) – when access to the  track is required, and the work is under the control of the  Station Controller, Yard Master, Traffic Controller or  relevant system controller(s) depending on the location.  

The time of work is determined by the  Project Manager  but, in  general, track related work is only to be carried out  approximately between 02:00 and 04:00 hours including for the  preparation, mobilisation and demobilisation periods, or as  stated in the Scope.  

#

G17.3.1  The  Contractor  provides a Risk Management Plan to establish  the methodology of implementing the management of risk for  the applicable scope of works to be delivered.      G17.3.2  The plan serves as the basic device for the  Contractor  to plan,  manage and control the PDRM process within his own  organisation and that of his appointed Subcontractor(s).      G17.3.3  The plan shows the complete range of activities to be  undertaken in order to achieve the PDRM requirements,  including issues of work sequencing and work interfaces with  other works contracts.      G17.3.4  The plan is updated as required by the  Project Manager .      G17.4.1  The  Contractor  arranges a formal initial risk workshop to identify  all risks to the successful delivery of the project together with  mitigation measures.        G17.4.2  In order to support the  Client  in carrying out quantitative risk  assessments, the  Contractor  quantifies relevant risks and  uncertainties with cost and time impacts. The methodology of  conducting the quantitative risk assessments is agreed with  Project Manager  .      G17.4.3  All risk workshops and reviews are led by the Risk Manager, or  a competent member of the  Contractor ’s construction team,  with substantial relevant construction expertise and in particular  with relevant experience in the review of construction methods.      G17.4.4  The Risk Manager summarises all the discussions and any  findings arising from and decisions made in the risk  management workshops in the risk progress report.      G17.4.5  The subject experts from the  Client  and  Contractor   organisations (including designers & construction managers)  with relevant experience participate in risk workshops and  reviews as required.      G17.4.6  All risks are recorded in the  Contractor ’s project delivery risk  register to be submitted monthly.      G17.4.7  The methodology of conducting the risk workshop and the  format of the  Contractor ’s risk register is agreed with the  Project  Manager .      G17.4.8  For each risk identified, the following information is provided as  a minimum:  

consequences;  

mitigation plans and risk ratings; and    (c)  qualitative risk assessments of the likelihood and severity  of each consequence category in accordance with the risk  matrix      G17.4.9  All Project Delivery risks are ranked in accordance with the  “Project Delivery Risk Matrix”. The risk assignment is based on  relevant historical data, where available, and engineering  judgement.      G17.4.10  Based on the current controls in place, the risks are evaluated  on a current risk rating.  The residual risk rating is assessed  based on the identified actions being implemented and having  the desired effect.      G17.4.11  The  Contractor  reviews and treats the identified risks in  accordance with the following principles:   (a)  for risks with a current risk rating of P1 or P2, control  actions are proposed to mitigate the risk to P3 or P4 level.  Where no practical project management, design and  construction solutions can be identified, the use of  procedural, and/or other risk reduction measures, as  agreed with the  Project Manager  , are considered;    (b)  for risks with a current risk rating of P3, justification or  evidence may be required to show that such risks have  been reduced to a level which is As Low As Reasonably  Practicable (ALARP); and    (c)  any risks with a current risk rating of P4 can be considered  as acceptable level and generally require regular  monitoring of their risk trends.      G17.4.12  For risks with possible cost and/or schedule impact, the  estimated costs and programme delay are provided by the  Contractor  for quantification purposes.      G17.4.13  In the event of significant changes to the works or a new  alternative design is proposed, further risk studies including  additional risk workshop(s) are conducted to identify the  changes to the project’s risk profile.      G17.4.14  The  Contractor  submits a record of the risks in the Contractor  Project Delivery Risk Register (in Microsoft  $\circledast$   Excel format),  together with the minutes of meeting after each risk workshop  and review, to the  Project Manager  for acceptance.      G17.4.15  The  Contractor  conducts monthly risk review and update the  Contractor Project Delivery Risk Register within 2 weeks until  Completion. The  Contractor  notifies the  Project Manager  in  Risk Progress  Report and  Register

G17.4.17  The  Contractor  allows for any design development or changes  arising from the control actions identified.      G17.4.18  The  Contractor  ensures that control actions are closed in a  timely manner. Control actions are closed out (i) before the end  of design stage - for design or planning related actions, and (ii)  before the end of construction stage – for construction related  actions. Other control actions which are considered beyond the  responsibility of the  Contractor  are highlighted to the  Project  Manager  .      G17.4.19  The  references  of  relevant  design  drawings/reports,  construction plans, interface documents, method statements,  test reports, as-built drawings etc. are documented in the  Contractor Project Delivery Risk Register as close-out  evidences for the control actions being implemented.      G17.4.20  Implementation of all control actions in construction documents  and on site is monitored and verified by the  Contractor . Further  verification of the completed control action(s) on site are  confirmed by the  Project Manager  as deemed necessary,  during site inspections.      G17.4.21  The  Contractor  submits a final update of the Contractor Project  Delivery Risk Register, with completion of all required control  actions, to the  Project Manager  before the completion of  contract or a date to be agreed with the  Project Manager .

(a)  Software to be used     (b)  Process overview     (c)  Responsibilities     (d)  Outputs     (e)  Technical query workflow     (f)  Clash resolution process     (g)  Tolerance levels (mm) for different discipline     (h)  Operation clearance     (i)  Maintenance clearance     (j)  Buildability     (k)  Services compatibility  

(l)  For Building services / MEP / E&M clash detection, the  Contractor  addresses the issue of replacing equipment  without a break in service. This is especially essential for  major equipment having a large footprint or "mission  critical"  equipment,  such  as  a  large  capacity  uninterruptible power supply together with its batteries,  low-voltage (LV) and high voltage (HV) switchboards,  transformer, emergency generator or other special  equipment as specified by the end-user etc. Dynamic  envelope model carrying the estimated dimension should  

be added in BIM models to allow and reserve sufficient  physical space for E&M equipment delivery, installation  sequence and maintenance purpose of such equipment.  The  Contractor  liaises with relevant O&M parties on such  spatial requirement for comment by the  Project Manager   resource deployment.

# REQUIREMENTS MANAGEMENT  

Requirements  Management  The  Contractor  adopts a formalised requirements management  process for requirements verification and traceability, providing  Requirements Management Plan which describes the process  of requirements management for the  Contractor ’s design and  construction activities and as a means of Verification and  Validation compliant with the latest version of ISO/IEC 15288.  

G19.1.2  The  Contractor  develops and maintains a Requirements  Verification  Traceability  Matrix  (RVTM)/Requirements  Verification Table (RVT) to capture, record, analyse, classify  and prioritise requirements, manage changes to requirements,  and maintain evidence of traceability to Design Deliverables,  verification and validation results, and any modifications made  during  Contractor’s  activities in accordance with the latest  version of ISO/IEC 15288.  

G19.1.3  The  Contractor  employs a Requirements Management Expert  to manage, develop and maintain the RVT and update  requirements verification and traceability mapping for all  requirements  included  in  this  contract  and  interface  requirements with other disciplines.  

# G19.1.4  

For the requirements verification and traceability, the  Contractor  provides comprehensive linkage and mapping in “Many to  Many” relationship between all relevant requirements and their  associated verification evidence or their derived requirements  (i.e.,  design  deliverables,  drawings,  calculations).  For  avoidance of doubt, the  Contractor  is to establish the linkage  and mapping in a “clause to clause(s)” and “clause to drawing  list(s)” fashion where a comprehensive relationship between the  requirements and all the evidence, to be agreed with the  Service Manager, can be demonstrated and traced.  

The verification evidence demonstrates the compliance of  criteria and standards in these documents has been achieved  in the final design.  

#  

RVT to report the verification or validation results demonstrating  the objective and performance criteria of the Scope  requirements have been met. It demonstrates that the verifiable  requirements in the Scope have been satisfactorily verified and  validated by providing evidence (e.g. acceptance of a relevant  test case) to each such Scope requirement.  

The Verification and Validation methods listed below are  acceptable if implemented adequately (whether singly or in  combination). Other methods may be proposed subject to the  

# consent of the  Client  

(a)  similarity – equipment and requirement are identical to  those successfully applied on other projects; 

  

 (b)  historical – requirement has been met by numerous  previous designs; 

  

 (c)  design review, including all calculations, drawings,  samples and catalogues; 

  

 (d)  mock-up – actual size representation of design; 

  

 (e)  development test – performance testing on equipment or  material under development; 

  

 (f)  type test – performance testing of the as-built component,  assembly or system; 

  

 (g)  accelerated life cycle test – demonstration of reliability and  availability; 

  

 (h)  routine test – test every component, assembly or system; 

  

 (i)  First Article Inspection (FAI) – acceptance of the exact  look and fit of equipment; 

  

 (j)  inspection – formal inspection of the finished item; and 

  

 (k)  in service performance – for service requirements  demonstration only 

  

 (l)  Demonstration – Visual checking of installation which may  involve dynamic set-up and interactive action during the  process.  The checking usually involves physical/visible  items  with  requirements  which  are  not  directly  measurable, examples are such as effectiveness of  equipment maintenance procedures and ergonomic  design. 

  

 (m) Analysis – Written presentation which contains logical  derivation and supported with sufficient technical  information leading to the intended conclusion of specific  setting and installation.  For examples, certificate  submission, analytical documentation, calculation, etc fall  into this category. 

  

 (n)  Simulation – Modelling of a real-life or hypothetical  situation on a computer 

  

 (o)  Test - Checking compliance of requirements with the use  of the target system and/or testing instruments. The  checking usually involves functional or non-physical  requirements, examples are such as system functions,  interface functions and EMC
