# Inspection and Testing  

Electrical installations on Site shall be inspected and tested in accordance  with the requirements of the Code of Practice for Electricity Wiring  Regulations.  Reference shall also be made to the MTRC Project Health  and Safety Manual.  

# APP/G.15.1  

# Identification  

Identification labels of an Approved type shall be affixed to all electrical  switches, circuit breakers and motors to specify their purpose.  

# APP/G.16.1  

# Maintenance  

Strict maintenance and regular checks of control apparatus and wiring  distribution systems shall be carried out by a qualified and suitably  categorised electrician to ensure safety and efficient operation.  The  Contractor shall submit for the Approval of the Engineer details of his  maintenance schedule and maintenance works record.  

# APP/G.17.1  

# Maintenance records  

All portable electrical appliances shall be permanently numbered (Scaff  Tag Labels or similar) and a record kept of the date of issue, date of the  last inspection carried out and the recommended inspection period.
