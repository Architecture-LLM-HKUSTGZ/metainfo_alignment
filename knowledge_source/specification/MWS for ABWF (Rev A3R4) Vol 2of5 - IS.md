Note 1:  Acceptance of Glazing works shall be subject to compliance of specified  performance requirement and testing on prototype.   Note 2:   Pre-selected materials are chosen to establish the minimum standard  performance criteria and requirements desired. Approved and equal quality  materials may be used, subject to compliance with requirements of this  section.  Note 3:  Refer to the performance clauses stated below for requirements.  Note 4:  The minimum thickness of glazing shall be in accordance with the  specification and drawings, and as required to comply with the  performance requirements.  

# IS29 - 4.0  Materials  

# IS29 - 4.1  General  

The Contractor shall fabricate glass to sizes required for glazing  openings indicated, with edge clearances and tolerances complying  with recommendations of glass manufacturer and the requirements  specified herein.  Provide glass thickness as recommended by glass  manufacturer for application indicated, but not less than the minimum  required satisfying specified performance requirements.  

The Contractor shall provide the following materials and products:  

# IS29 - 4.2  Specified materials  

IS29 - 4.2.1  CLEAR FLOAT GLASS  

a  Float glass (raw material for glazing) in accordance with the  referenced standards  b  Colour shall be clear, with minimum   $84\%$   transmittance in visible  light, unless otherwise specified in the drawings.  

# Section IS 29: Glazing  

c  Fabricated to the sizes required for glazing openings as  indicated in the Drawings, with edge clearances and tolerances  complying with recommendations of glass manufacturer and the  requirements specified herein.   d  Glass thickness as recommended by glass manufacturer for  application as indicated, but not less than minimum, required to  satisfy specified Performance Requirements.  

IS29 - 4.2.2  CLEAR FLOAT GLASS (LOW IRON)  

a  Float glass (raw material for glazing associated with artwork) in  accordance with the referenced standards  b  Colour  shall  be  clear,  high-clarity glass that  is  made  from silica with very low amounts of iron (ferric oxide content \~   $0.01\%)$  . This low level of iron removes the greenish-blue tint that  can be seen especially on larger and thicker sizes of glass.  c  Fabricated to the sizes required for glazing openings as  indicated in the Drawings, with edge clearances and tolerances  complying with recommendations of glass manufacturer and the  requirements specified herein.   d  Glass thickness as recommended by glass manufacturer for  application as indicated, but not less than minimum, required to  satisfy specified Performance Requirements.  

IS29 - 4.2.3  HEAT STRENGTHENED GLASS  

Glass shall be in accordance with the referenced standard and  complying with the following requirements:  

a  Glass shall be heat strengthened to achieve the surface  compressive stress value of 25 to 69MPa, as measured by  differential stress refractometer.  b  Colour shall be clear, with minimum   $84\%$   transmittance in visible  light.  c  Thickness shall be min.    $10~\mathsf{m m}$   and as required to comply with  the performance requirements.  d  All glass shall be heat conditioned (heat soaked) as for  TOUGHENED GLASS.  

IS29 - 4.2.4  TOUGHENED GLASS  

For the purpose of this Specification section, the term “toughened”,  and “fully tempered” are synonymous.  Glass shall be in accordance  

# Section IS 29: Glazing  

with the referenced standard and complying with the following  requirements:  

a  Glass shall be both fully tempered, and heat soaked to achieve  a surface compressive stress value of not less than 69 MPa, as  measured by differential stress refractometer.  b  All glass shall be heat treated to meet the minimum structural  requirements of the Glazing systems. Thickness shall be  verified by the Contractor according to the requirements of the  Specification  and  subject  to  the  minimum  thickness  requirements.  c  Glass equal to or less than   $12~\mathsf{m m}$   thick (before lamination)  shall have arris edges.  For glass over   $12\ \mathsf{m m}$   thick the edges  shall be ground to a flat profile with smooth arris.  Edges shall  have a frosted appearance.  d  Edge work, holes and notches in tempered glass shall be  completed  before  tempering  and  shall  comply  with  requirements  of  the  manufacturer’s  tempered  glass  specification.   e  Tempering shall be performed on a roller hearth furnace  eliminating tong marks.  f  Roller wave shall be measured periodically after the tempering  stage has been completed.  Roller wave distortion shall be  measured by the manufacturer’s standard measurement  method.  Maximum allowable peak to trough variation shall be   $0.05\ \mathsf{m m}$   with maximum sag at the leading and trailing edge of   $0.25\,\mathrm{\mm}$  .  Roller waves shall be unnoticeable when viewed  from a distance of 3 meters.  g  The glass panel shall be subjected to quality control measures  (i.e. heat soaking) to minimize the presence of inclusions which  could result in spontaneous breakage.
