The surface condition between the bearing and the testing machine loading plates  shall be prepared so as to simulate the actual conditions.  

# 2.1.3.8  Dynamic Stiffness Tests  

2.1.3.8.1  Dynamic Stiffness tests shall be performed on two samples each of complete  support bearings, side bearings and end bearings by using either the mass loading  or applied dynamic force procedure.  

2.1.3.8.2  Mass Loading Procedure  

The bearings shall be loaded with a 1000 g mass and then a vertical shock load  imparted to the centre of the loading plate or block.  (The side and end bearings  shall be turned from normal position for this test so that the mass load is applied to  the side faces).  The amplitude and frequency of movement of the load shall be  determined by the use of an accelerometer and oscilloscope or strip chart recorder.   The frequency of the fundamental or lowest vertical oscillation frequency shall be  determined by counting the sinusoidal peaks for a given time interval.  With this  procedure the dynamic spring rate  $\mathsf{K}_{\mathsf{d}}$   shall then be determined by:-  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathsf{K}_{\mathsf{d}}\,}&{{}\,=\,39.5\,\mathsf{m}\,\mathsf{f}_{\mathsf{n}}^{2}}\\ {\mathsf{K}_{\mathsf{d}}\,}&{{}\,=\,\mathsf{d y n a m i c\,s p r i n g\,r a t e},(\mathsf{N}/\mathsf{m})}\\ {\mathsf{f}_{\mathsf{n}}\,}&{{}\,=\,\mathsf{o b s e r v e d\,n a t u r a l\,f r e q u e n c y},(\mathsf{H}z)}\\ {\mathsf{m}\,}&{{}\,=\,\mathsf{l o a d\,m a s s},(\mathsf{k g})}\end{array}
$$  

2.1.3.8.3  Dynamic Force Procedure  

To determine the dynamic stiffness a compression force sufficient to deflect the  bearing  $5.0\:\mathsf{m m}$   shall be applied and a sinusoidal varying force sufficient to deflect  the bearing   $1.0\:\mathsf{m m}$   peak-to-peak at a frequency of   $10\:\mathsf{H z}$   superimposed.  The test  shall be repeated at frequencies of   $15\:\mathsf{H}z$   and   $_{20~\mathsf{H}z}$  .  Alternatively, extrapolation  from a lower frequency range into this range may be permitted.  The dynamic  stiffness shall be the measured maximum-to-minimum force divided by the  measured maximum-to-minimum deflection. A static load test shall be conducted  immediately after the dynamic test with the elastomer at the same internal  temperature for both tests.  Static stiffness,  $\mathsf{K_{t a n^{\prime}}}$   at  $5.0\:\mathsf{m m}$   deflection shall be used  for determining the ratio of dynamic-to-static stiffness with the dynamic force  procedure.  

# 2.1.3.9  Long Term Creep Test  

$
 \begin{table}[!ht]\begin{center}\begin{small}\begin{sc}\begin{tabular}{llll}& A long term creep test shall be performed on one support bearing as part of the qualification tests and production tests listed in Table 1 of Clause 2.14.4 of this Appendix. \\[2mm]2.1.39.1 & Long Term CEEP Test Procedure \\[2mm]& A compressive force shall be applied to the bearing of magnitude equal to the median of the stiffness evaluation load range in Clause 2.12.7 (static stiffness) of this Appendix using steel loading plates of sufficient thickness to assume uniform loading.

# APPENDIX 2.2  

# FLOATING SLAB TRACK (HIGH PERFORMANCE) BEARING SPECIFICATION  

2.2.1   GENERAL  

(a)   Three types of elastomeric bearings are required :  

(1)  support bearings, cylindrical in shape, required to support in the vertical  direction the weight of the floating slabs, the trackwork and the train;  (2)  side bearings, rectangular in shape and vulcanised to their associated  steelwork, which maintain lateral positioning of the slabs and resist lateral  curving loads of the train; and  (3)  end bearings, three variants – all rectangular in plan and with different  thickness; these bearings maintain longitudinal positioning of the slabs and  resist longitudinal braking and acceleration forces.  Some variants of end  bearings may be perforated with one or more cut outs in order to achieve  both dimensional and stiffness requirements.  

(b)   The support bearings shall have thin disc-shaped reinforcing layers affixed to  the elastomer on the top and bottom contact surfaces of the bearing.  The  diameter of these layers shall equal that of the bearing.  The exterior (disc)  faces of the two reinforcing layers are thus to be in contact with adjacent  supporting concrete.  These layers shall be very stiff in the plane of the disc in  order to minimise differential slip on the bearing contact surfaces while under  service loads, and shall be sufficiently compliant with respect to out-of-plane  deformations so as to minimize stress concentrations that may otherwise occur  within the adjacent supporting concrete.  

(c)   The layered reinforcement in the support bearings shall be achieved by one of  two alternatives:  (1)  Dual Compound Support Bearing:  each reinforcing layer is to be composed  of hard rubber impregnated with fibres, and moulded on the top and bottom  contact surfaces of the bearing.  (2)  Layered Support Bearing:  each reinforcing layer shall consist of a thin steel  plate, with diameter slightly less than that of the bearing, which is moulded  into the bearing so that a thin layer of elastomer separates the metal plate  from direct contact with any concrete support surface.  (d)   The elastomeric component of all support, end and side bearings, but excluding  the reinforcing layers within the dual compound support bearing alternative,  shall be fabricated from natural rubber as formulated in this Appendix.  The  natural rubber formulation shall be the same for all bearings; thus, the required  stiffness of each bearing shall be achieved by differences in geometry. This  elastomeric component is to be referred to as soft rubber.  (e)   Shop drawings showing full details of fabrication and assembly shall be  submitted for Review prior to any manufacture or testing of the individual types  (f)   Prior to any production work being carried out, the Contractor shall carry out  tests in accordance with Clause 2.2.4.4 of this Appendix to demonstrate the  

acceptance criteria. 

 (g)   During production of the bearings, Routine tests shall be carried out in  accordance with Clause 2.2.4.5 of this Appendix on samples taken from the  production line. The number and frequency of the tests shall be determined by  the Contractor to suit his production methods, subject to the minimum  requirements of Clause 2.2.4.5 of this Appendix. Prior to commencement of  production, the Contractor shall submit his proposed Schedule of Tests for  Review. 

 (h)   Notwithstanding the Review of the Schedule of Tests in accordance with the  Clause 2.2.1 (g) of this Appendix, the Engineer may order additional tests,  should he have reason to doubt the production quality of the bearings, which  shall be at Contractor’s expense. 

 (i)   All testing shall be carried out in accordance with Clause 2.2.4.2 of this  Appendix and under the supervision of the Engineer. 

 (j)   Each bearing shall be permanently identified by a code showing the name of  manufacturer, batch number, the date of manufacture and any pertinent  information necessary to relate the materials to the appropriate or required test  reports. 

 (k)   The Contractor shall submit to the Engineer for Review within 60 days of the  Commencement of Work details of the bearing sub contractors. 

 (l)   The Contractor shall submit the results of the Prototype testing to the Engineer  within 210 days of the Commencement of Work. 

 (m)   The information contained herein shall be used when developing the Factory  Testing Plan and Procurement, Manufacturing and Delivery Plan identified in  accordance with Clauses of Section 8 and 9 of General Specification for  Trackwork and Overhead Line System.  SPECIFIC Requirements  Steel Components and Vulcanisation 

 (a)   Side bearings shall be hot vulcanised to a 10mm thick steel backing plate as  shown on the Drawings. 

 (b)   The steel backing plate shall be galvanised but with vulcanisation between the  

rubber and molecularly clean steel.

For each load increment, the compression of the  bearing shall be measured to an accuracy of at least 0.025 mm and recorded.   The results shall be plotted for every bearing tested on a graph of the  compression load vs. deflection for at least two complete load cycles.  The  minimum resolution of the load vs. deflection curve shall be in the maximum  load increments given in Table 1 of this Appendix for the bearing type, with  continuous plotting by machine preferable.

 2.2.3.5.3   Procedure: To determine the dynamic stiffness, apply a compression force  sufficient to deflect the bearing   $7.0~\mathsf{m m}$   and superimpose a sinusoidal varying  force sufficient to deflect the bearing 1.0 mm peak-to-peak at a frequency of 5  Hz.  Repeat the test at frequencies of   $10\:\mathsf{H}z$   and  $_{20\,\mathsf{H}z}$  . Repeat the test with 0.5  mm peak-to-peak deflection at  $5\:{\sf H}z$  ,   $10\:\mathsf{H}z$   and  $_{20\,\mathsf{H}z}$  .  The dynamic stiffness is  the measured maximum-to-minimum force divided by the measured maximum- to-minimum deflection.  Without removing the bearing from the test machine, a  static load test shall be conducted immediately after the dynamic test with the  elastomer at the same internal temperature for both tests.  The maximum load  (unload) increment shall not exceed 2 kN/mm.  The static secant stiffness  between   $7.0\ \mathsf{m m}$   and  $7.5\:\mathsf{m m}$   deflection obtained from this test shall be used for  determining the ratio of dynamic-to-static stiffness.

The force shall be maintained for 14 days.   Deflection shall be measured at 10 minutes after application of load and then at  intervals of decades of minutes up to ten thousand minutes and at the end of  the 14 day period.  Plot the deflection versus   $I o g_{10}$   of time and derive the creep  rate from the slope of the line obtained from a least squares fit to the data.   Determine deflection at 1 minute from application of load by extending the least  squares fit graph of creep deflection versus   $\mathsf{l o g}_{10}$   time to 1 minute. 

 2.2.3.6.3  Acceptance Criterion: The creep rate, as determined from the least squares fit,  shall not exceed   $1.5\%$   of the 1 minute deflection per decade of time.

One cycle is defined as monotonically increasing the load from the minimum of   $1.5~\mathsf{k N}$   to the maximum of   $50~\mathsf{k N}$   and then monotonically decreasing the load  from  $50\,\,{\sf k N}$   back to   $1.5\,\mathsf{k N}$  .  The cycling rate shall ensure that overheating of the  block pad does not occur. 

 2.2.3.7.3  Acceptance Criteria: the support bearing shall withstand the specified total  number of cycles of load application with no evidence of failure.

Flash-Butt   4.87  Welding - General  

(1)   Before any rail end preparation for welding is undertaken, all rail ends required to be welded shall be checked by the Contractor to ensure that the rail end straightness, both horizontally and vertically, is within tolerance.  The rail end straightness shall be checked by the welding machine  manufacturer to ensure the specified finished weld alignment tolerances are achieved within the Clause 4.86(13) grinding limits.  

(2)  Rails outside the required end straightness tolerance shall  not be welded and shall be removed from the Site.   Alternatively   the   damaged   rail   end may be cut, as described  in Section 4 - Cutting of Rails, to produce a rail with an  acceptable rail end straightness. This rail, if shorter than  18m may then be used as a closure rail.  Welds that are out of tolerance for straightness may be straightened by the  use   of a purpose made Approved rail end straightener, post  welding.   The rail   weld   straightening   process   shall   not induce  residual stresses into the rail or weld nor indentations as  described in Clause 4.88(6).  

(3)  Approved   rail   ends   shall   be   thoroughly   cleaned on the ends,  and for a minimum of   $600\:\mathsf{m m}$   from the end (or as required  by the welding system), by portable dry shot blasting and  grinding. Dry shot blasting shall cover the whole rail surface  whilst grinding shall be localised to remove raised rail  markings and corrosion protection as necessary to give a  good, clean and even surface for electrode contact.  

(4)  The mating rail ends, prior to welding, shall be square both  horizontally and vertically to within   $0.5\mathsf{m m}$  , and when  clamped in the welder and mated there shall not be a gap  at any point in excess of 2 mm.  

(5)  The welding machine shall be capable of automatically  aligning the rail ends, prior to welding, and securely  clamping the rail ends to prevent movement of the joint  alignment during the welding process.  The minimum  clamping force shall be one and a half times the required  upset or forging force, and shall be provided by a clamping  system that is independent from the electrodes.  

(6)  All flash-butt welded rails to be installed in track with a  centre line radius equal to or less than 500m shall be stress  relieved in accordance with one of the procedures given in  Appendix 4.5 and 4.6 of this document.  The choice of  procedure adapted shall be at the Contractors discretion.  

(7)  Exceptions to stress relieving may be considered providing  the  flash-butt  welding  machine  manufacture  can  demonstrate his process does not cause residual stresses,  in the rail web in particular, post welding.  

(8)  Residual stresses shall be measured by the Contractor at  an independent test facility, as a demonstration of the  manufacturer’s claim, on both sides of the rail and weld at  the neutral axis and 15mm above by the use of bi-axial  strain gauges.  These measurements shall be undertaken  at independent test facilities.

(4)  The weld shall be checked after stripping for tears and  other imperfections before being finished to final profile by  controlled grinding.  

(5)  The rails shall be inspected after welding and prior to profile  grinding, using a minimum 1000mm notched straight edge,  to ensure the head of the rail immediately either side of the  centre of the weld is not dipped but hogged up to a  maximum of 0.50mm.  The sides of the weld shall also be  checked and the horizontal tolerance shall be within   $+/-$  0.25mm when measured with the rail laid straight.  

(6)  Welds that do not meet the requirements of Clause 4.88(5)  above shall be rejected or shall be straightened using  Approved equipment only. The straightening operation shall  not cause indentations of any degree to be produced in the  rail, particularly the rail head, nor induce residual stresses  into the rail or weld.  The Contractor shall demonstrate, by  Approved means, that no residual stresses have been  induced by his proposed straightening operation.  

(7)  All welded joints shall be inspected after profile grinding to  check the ground area is smooth, within the limits of  Clause(s) 4.86(13) and 4.88(8) and there are no signs of  surface defects or discontinuities liable to affect the weld.

# 4.2.3  PROCEDURE  

(a)  Holes in the rail shall be drilled in accordance with Section 4 - Drilling of Rails,  to the required diameter and thoroughly cleaned of oil and debris.  Only oil  free cleaning solutions shall be applied to each hole and then wiped clean  and dry. 

  

 (b)  The hole shall then be checked with the correct sized gauge to ensure the  correct diameter has been achieved and that the hole is round. 

  

 (c)  Holes that are not round, or to an incorrect diameter, may be reamed 1mm  (maximum) oversize to achieve on acceptable diameter and shape providing  this new diameter is within the mandrel range available. 

  

 (d)  Should the requirements of Clauses 4.2.3(b)&(c) of this Appendix be  unachievable a new rail or manufactured component shall be provided. 

  

 (e)  The operator is to select a mandrel for each hole.   Each mandrel shall be  thoroughly cleaned before and after every usage. 

  

 (f)  The metal split sleeve of the mandrel is to be replaced after one usage.  New  metal split sleeves shall be placed over the mandrel with the flared collar  facing away from the pulling end.  The split sleeve is to be located such that  it is at the pulling end of the plain shank of the mandrel. 

  

 (g)  Each mandrel shall be placed in the hole such that all the pulling ends are on  one side of the rail.  The mandrels are to be gently tapped with a lead or  copper hammer into each hole such that the sleeve enters the hole as far as  the collar.  The operator shall ensure that the split in the sleeve is facing  away from the rail end at the east and west position of the hole so that a tell- tale indentation is left in the hole as physical proof that it has been cold  expanded.  

(h)  The operator shall ensure that the equipment has been set up correctly and  that all hydraulic pipes are properly connected.  The hydraulic mandrel puller  shall first be set so it is fully extended.  The puller is placed over the first  mandrel and set to retract the mandrel.  The operator shall ensure the puller  is fully located on the mandrel and that it is firmly pressed against the web of  the rail. 

  

 (i)  The extractor will slowly pull the mandrel through the rail leaving the sleeve in  the hole.  The sleeve should not pull through the hole with the mandrel.  If  this occurs the operation has not been successfully achieved and the  process shall to be repeated. 

  

 (j)  The mandrel will emerge from the rail enclosed within the extractor.  To  remove the mandrel the operator shall fully extend the puller whereupon the  mandrel will drop from the extractor.  Under no circumstances shall the  operator attempt to remove the mandrel whilst the puller is fully retracted. 

  

 (k)  Each mandrel is extracted using the same procedure. 

  

 (l)  The sleeves shall be removed from each of the holes and the holes cleaned.   The operator shall check the hole size with the gauges to ensure the  required size has been achieved. 

  

 (m)  Sleeves shall not to be reused for more than one hole.  Used sleeves shall  be kept separate from new ones before being disposed of. 

  

 (n)  Mandrels can be reused for a number of holes.  If a mandrel begins  producing undersized holes then it shall be replaced.

During this period of  time, the location and width of the cracks on the   loaded  concrete block shall be measured and recorded.  

(5)  The crack widths shall be measured at the level  corresponding to the theoretical position of the centroid of  the lower reinforcement.  If it is not possible to measure a  crack at this level due to chipping of the concrete or surface  imperfections, measurements shall be taken equidistant  above and below this level; the two values shall be  averaged to obtain the width of the crack and recorded.   Once the load has been released, the width of the cracks on  the side surfaces of the unloaded concrete block shall be  measured and recorded.  

(6)  P2 shall be defined as the peak load of the last cycle in  which the widest crack on the concrete block is closed after  the removal of the load.

# Rail Seat  5.51  Negative Bending  Moment Test  

(7)  P3 shall be defined as the peak load of the last cycle in  which the opening of the widest crack on the concrete block  after the removal of the load is not greater than   $0.5\ \mathsf{m m}$  After reaching level P3, the load shall be increased at a rate  of 20 kN/minute until the ultimate failure of the concrete  block.  P3 shall exceed 360kN. 

  

 (8)  P4 shall be defined as the maximum load carried by the  concrete block.

 (4)  P'1 shall be defined as the load required to generate the first  crack.  It shall be recorded but no minimum value is  specified. 

  

 (5)  P'2 shall be defined as the peak load of the last cycle in  which the widest crack on the concrete block is closed after  the removal of the load.  A crack whose width does not  exceed 0.05 mm shall be considered to be closed.  P'2 shall  exceed 180kN.  

(6)  P'3 shall be defined as the peak load of the last cycle in  which the opening of the widest crack on the concrete block  after removal of the load is not greater than 0.5 mm. P'3  shall exceed 270kN.

# APPENDIX 5.3  

# ULTRASONIC TEST PROCEDURE  

# General  

Initial Rail   Scan   $(0^{\circ})$  

# Tandem Probe  Scan Procedure  

5.3.1  This procedure details the manner in which rail welds shall be  ultrasonically tested in the track.  The rail either side of the weld  shall be initially scanned for horizontal defects, and subsequently  three tests shall be applied to both fusion faces of the weld.  These  scans shall detect vertically oriented lack of fusion defects in the  head, web and foot areas of the welded joint.  Calibrations quoted  are to suit 60E1 or 54E1 rail section.  The following apparatus is  required:  

(a)  Portable Ultrasonic Flaw Detector - Krautkramer  USL32 or other Approved model.     (b)  Tandem Probe Rig with two removable   $45^{\circ}$  ,  $\mathcal{Z}^{1/_{2}}$   MHz  Probes.    (c)   $0^{\circ}$  ,  $\mathcal{Z}^{1/_{2}}$   MHz, Single Crystal Rail Testing Probe.    (d)  Miniature   $70^{\circ}$  , 4 MHz, Single Crystal Probe.    (e)  Metric Calibration Block.    (f)  Couplant, eg Detergent.    (g)  Wire Brush and Scraper. 

 5.3.2  (1)   Prior to the application of any scan to the fusion faces of the weld   $500~\mathsf{m m}$   of the rail on either side of the joint shall be scanned for horizontal defects using the   $0^{\circ}$   probe.  At the same   time the rail depth either side of the weld shall be measured and recorded.     (2)  The timescale shall be calibrated for 200mm full scale,  using the 70mm dimension of the metric calibration block  and the  $0^{\circ}$   probe. 

 5.3.3  (1)   The tandem probe scan shall be applied to detect lack of fusion defects on the vertical fusion faces in the head and web of the welded joint.  The area covered by this scan is shown schematically in Figure 1.     (2)  Using one of the  $45^{\circ}$   probes from the tandem probe rig, and  the 50 mm quadrant of the metric calibration block, the  timescale shall be calibrated for   $250\:\mathsf{m m}$   full scale.  The  other   $45^{\circ}$   probe shall then be connected to the instrument  and the switch made to double probe working.  

(3)  Attach the probes such that the probe connected to the TX  socket is nearest the datums line, and is \`looking away' from  the weld. The second probe, connected to the RX socket,  shall be \`looking' towards the weld.  This arrangement is  illustrated in Figure 2.  

(4)  By movement of the probes along the probe guide,  maximise the signal from rail bottom.  Using the attenuation  control set this signal to full screen height and add 10 dB.  

(5)  Remove the TX probe from its carriage and replace it such  that the probe \`looks' towards the weld.  After ensuring that  adequate couplant has been applied, move the probes  backwards and forwards along the probe guide.  

(6)  Signals from any lack of fusion defect present should  appear   at approximately the same range as the signal used  to set the sensitivity, see Figure 3.  This scan shall be  applied twice, once from each side of the weld.  

(7)  If a defect signal is found the operator shall record its  amplitude, and the stand-off distance of the TX probe  measured from the datums line on the probe rig.  If the  defect signal reaches an amplitude of   $\%$   screen height the  weld will be rejected and shall be removed from the track.  

Scanning of  5.3.4  Lower Wed and  Foot from Rail  Head  

(1)   This scan is required to inspect the fusion face of the weld in  the lower web/foot of the rail for lack of fusion defects extending to the rail bottom.  The area covered by the scan is shown schematically in Figure 4.  

(2)  Timescale calibration shall be carried out as stipulated in  item 5.3.2 (2) of this Appendix.  Following this remove both  probes from their carriages, disconnect the RX probe from  the instrument and switch to single crystal working. The  calibration may then be checked using the metric calibration  block.  The test sensitivity specified for the tandem rig scan  shall be maintained during this test.  

(3)  To scan the lower fusion face place the probe on the rail  head such that the stand-off distance from the centre-line of  the weld to the probe index is approximately equal to rail  depth i.e. 153mm for 54E1 and 172mm for 60E1 section rail.   Scan the lower fusion face by moving the probe about 40  mm either side of this position, see Figure 5.  

(4)  Signals from lack of fusion defects should appear at a range  approximately equal to the slant range of the rail section  being tested for 54E1 the range is 216mm, and for 60E1 the  range is 243mm), though this is dependant upon rail depth  see Figure 5.  This scan shall be applied twice, once from  each side of the weld.  

(5)  If a defect signal is found, the operator shall record the  amplitude and probe stand-off distance from the weld  centre-line.  If the defect signal reaches 1/2 screen height  the weld will be rejected and shall be removed from the  track.  

# Scanning of Rail  5.3.5  Foot  

(1)   This scan is required to inspect the fusion faces in the rail  foot, (outside of the central area) for lack of fusion defects. Figure 6 illustrates schematically the area covered by this scan.  

(2)  The foot of the rail, either side of the weld, shall be cleaned  of all encrusted dirt and rust on the surface using the wire  brush and scraper.  

(3)  Timescale calibration shall be carried out by using the 5  MHz, single crystal,   $70^{\circ}$   probe, and the 50mm quadrant of  metric calibration block the timescale shall be calibrated for   $200~\mathsf{m m}$   full scale.  The use of a 0-6 divisional screen will  make this calibration easier to carry out.  

(4)  Place the probe on the side of the calibration block and  obtain the 1/2 skip signal from the edge of the block. This  signal should maximise at a range of about 58mm. at the  division on the time scale, see Figure 7.  Once maximised,  the attenuator shall be used to set this signal to full screen  height and add 10 dB.  

(5)  Place the probe on the outer flat, portion (toe) of the rail foot  such that the probe index is about 40mm from the weld  reinforcement.  This area of the fusion face shall then be  scanned by moving the probe laterally and transversely with  respect to the weld, see Figure 8.  The transverse  movement must be at least   $40\:\mathsf{m m}$   either side of the  position described above.  In order to detect lack of fusion  defects in the extreme edge of the foot, rotational movement  of the probe shall also be conducted, see Figure 8.  

(6)  Having scanned from the outer, flat, portion of the rail foot,  the probe shall be placed on the sloping portion of the rail  foot (ankle), such that the probe index is 75mm from the  weld reinforcement.  This area may then be scanned in the  manner described in item 5.3.5(5) of this Appendix, except  that the transverse movement should be 75 mm to either  side of the position described therein, see Figure 9.   Rotational movement of the probe shall also be necessary  in order to detect lack of fusion defects in the extreme edge  of the rail foot in this area, see Figure 9.  

(7)  The scanning of fusion faces shall be applied four times on  each weld as shown in Figure 10.  

(8)  If a defect signal is found the operator shall record its  amplitude, and the probe stand-off position from the edge of  the weld reinforcement.  If a defect signal reaches 1/3  screen height the weld will be rejected and shall be  removed from the track.  

Overall  Acceptance  Criteria  

(1)   The individual test percentages in each fusion face shall be added and the sum shall not exceed the percentages quoted in a) and or b) below:  

a)  The total percentage failure in each fusion face shall  be limited to a maximum of   $100\%$  .    b)  The total percentage for both fusion faces when  added together shall not exceed   $180\%$  .  

(2)  No individual area test percentage used in Clause 5.3.6(1)  of this Appendix shall be in excess of that specified.

(12)  The Contractor, and or his independent test house, shall  produce a report of each rail weld failure for submission.   The report shall clearly identify the reasons for the failure  and recommend, for Approval, all necessary revision to the  weld process to avoid a repeat of the failure.  

5.4.2  (1)   The weld test evaluation of alumino thermic welds shall be  

# Evaluation  

(a)  If the weld passes the test no further action is  required.  

(b)  If the weld fails the test a further test weld shall be  made and subjected to another bend test.  The  second test weld shall be produced with weld  material from the same batch as the first weld for  alumino thermic welds.  It shall in all cases also be  produced by the same welder as the first weld.  

(d)  If the second weld fails the test, no further welding  shall be undertaken by the responsible welder and  no material used from the identified alumino thermic  weld material batch until the Contractor has  established the cause of the failure, it has been been  fully reported described, accepted and the alumino  thermic weld supplier's recommendations received  and Approved by the Engineer.  The welder shall not  undertake further welding until he has been retrained  and re-certified, should the result of the failures be  identified as workmanship.  

(2)  The weld test evaluation of flash-butt welds shall be as  follows:  

(a)  Weld not broken at the recommended maximum  load:  

The test is terminated and the weld is deemed to  have met the required standard.  Production may  commence or continue.  

(b)  Weld exceeds the minimum load but fractures before  reaching the recommended maximum load:  

The test is deemed to have met the required  standard   and   production   may   commence or continue  provided no die burns are present and all fracture  surfaces are inspected in accordance with Clause  5.4.1 (11) of this Appendix.  

(c)  The rail fractures away from the weld:  

The fracture surface shall be examined for evidence  of die burns and should any die burns be detected  their cause shall be identified and the problem  corrected  before  production  commences  or  continues.  

(d)  If the weld is deemed to have failed, for whatever  reason, a retest is required in accordance with  Clause 5.4.1 & 5.4.2(3) of this Appendix.  The  fracture surfaces shall be examined in accordance  with Clause 5.4.1.(11) and (12) of this Appendix, and  should die burns be evident their cause shall be  eliminated and their absence from retest welds  verified before production commences.  

(3)  Retest: In the event of the bend test failing to meet the  appropriate standard, the procedure for retesting shall be as  follows:  

(a)  Failure has occurred in a roughly vertical transverse  plane down the weld or within 25 mm of the weld  centre line:  

(i)  If the failed test had been produced at the start of a  shift or prior to production, subsequent welds shall be  tested until a satisfactory test has been completed  (minor corrective attention to the welding process,  may be necessary).  Immediately after rectification  two consecutive "production" welds shall test  satisfactorily before production can commence or  continue.  

(ii)  Depending upon the cause of the failure, it may be  necessary to test sample welds from the previous  shift in accordance with Clause 4.90(3).  

(iii)  If the failed test weld has been made at the end of a  shift or production run, the previous two production  welds shall be tested.   Failure of either of these two  at or within 25 mm of the weld line will result in all  production welds subsequent to the previous  satisfactory test being similarly rejected.  

(b)  Failure has occurred in the parent material more than  25 mm either side of the weld centre line (provided  no die burns are evident):  

(i)  If the test weld had been made at the start of the shift  or production run, subsequent tests shall be made  until the problem has been rectified.  If failure in the  parent rail continues the rail shall be considered to  be suspect then reference to the rail manufacturer  shall be made by the Contractor.  When the problem  has been rectified two consecutive "production"  welds  shall  be  accepted  before  production  commences.  

(ii)  If the test weld has been taken during a shift or  production run, the weld manufactured immediately  prior to the test weld shall be tested.   Should this fail  in a similar manner the previous two welds shall be  tested.  Should either of these fail in a similar manner,  all the rail welded subsequent to the previous  satisfactory test shall be considered suspect, and  shall be rejected.  

(iii)  For failures in accordance with (i) & (ii) above the  Contractor shall, in parallel with any site investigation  by  himself,  implement  the  Clause  4.86(14)  independent investigations.  

Slow Bend  5.4.3  (1)   The slow bend test machine shall be installed in a separate  Test Machine  room or building to the control centre or recording system.     (2)  The slow bend test machine shall be of minimum capacity 0  to 2000kN and be hydraulically operated.  

(3)  The rate of feed shall be as proposed by the Contractor and  Approved by the Engineer.  

calibrated at a maximum of 6 monthly intervals. 

  

 (5)  A record of all routine zeroing checking and calibration shall  be kept by the Contractor for inspection of the Engineer at  any time. 

  

 (6)  Should a rail fracture occur during testing the Contractor  shall have the machine supplier to check the machine for  damage and it shall be independently recalibrated. 

  

 (7)  The calibration tolerance for pressure shall ± 1 bar over a  range of 0 - 700 bar, and the tolerance for the load shall be   $\pm5\%$   over a range of 0 - 2000kN. 

  

 (8)  The test equipment shall have a valid certificate of  calibration which shall be prominently displayed at the test  premises.   

 (9)  The slow bed test machine shall graphically produce a  constant load deflection diagram both in hard copy and  electronically.  

(10)  The graph shall be accompanied by a test weld record to  show:  

(a)  the name and signature of the tester;  (b)  the date the test was carried out;  (c)  the test number;  (d)  the hydraulic pressure in the load ram;  (e)  the rail section and grade;  (f)  deflection;  (g)  the load applied;  (h)  the weld number;  (i)  whether the weld is a pass or a failure;  (j)  type of test (e.g. PT - proving test, PQT  $=$  production  quality test);  (k)  the rail cast numbers.  

(11)  The test machine room and control room shall both be  environmentally controlled to an ambient air temperature of   $_{22\cdot25^{\circ}\bigcirc}$  .  

(12)  The load for the slow bend test shall be applied at a  maximum rate of 30 kN/sec.  

# Presentation of test reports  

(13)  The Contractor shall compile a report containing details of  each test weld produced during the test programme.  The  report shall include the test weld record, the bend test  results and the resulting action (if applicable), and shall be  forwarded to the Engineer.
