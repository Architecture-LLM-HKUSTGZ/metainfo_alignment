11.3  (1) Concrete is classified with regard to temperature,  cement content, cementitious content, testing and  other technical requirements as Category A, B or C.   Details of the technical requirements are given  elsewhere in this Section.  Definition of the category  of individual elements of the Works shall be as stated  in the sub-clauses (2) to (4) unless otherwise stated in  the Contract.  

(2) Category A concrete shall generally include concrete  elements for the external structural envelope of  underground structures, concrete for watertight  structures, water retaining structures and bridges but  excluding those concrete elements classified as C in  (4) below.

$  

(4) In exceptional circumstances the Engineer may  require special additives or ingredients to be  incorporated in mixes, and in such cases these will be  specified in the Contract.  Alternatively, the Contractor  may propose such special additives or ingredients, the  use of which will be subject to the Engineer's Approval.  

(5) All materials used in concrete shall be fully identified  and shall be traceable to their sources of extraction or  manufacture.  

# Mix Design  Responsibility  

11.5  (1) Unless otherwise stated in the Contract, concrete  mixes shall be designed by the Contractor and shall  comply with the requirements stated in this  Specification.  However it is recognised that the  Contractor may wish to use mixes which are in regular  use and which are obtainable from, and designed by,  a specialist concrete supplier.  Subject to the prior  approval of the Engineer such commercially available  mixes may be used.  These mixes shall meet all the  requirements stated in this Specification and the  Engineer will require evidence of the methods by  which it is intended to achieve the compressive  strength and standard deviations hitherto achieved for  each mix, before Approval is given.  

(2) The source of any external supply of concrete  designed by the concrete supplier shall not be  changed without the prior approval of the Engineer.  

# Workability  

(1) The workability of concrete is not specified but shall be  proposed by the Contractor.  Concrete workability of  less than 75mm slump will not normally be acceptable.   Self-compacting concrete (SCC), if used, shall  conform to BS EN 206:2013.  The Contractor will be  required to carry out specific mock-up trials to  demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Engineer that the  proposed workability, not limited to SCC mixes, will  enable the concrete to be placed and compacted to  form a dense homogenous mass of concrete.  Trial  concrete shall be placed and compacted simulating  the actual locations where the concrete is proposed to  be used.  

(2) Except for medium workability mixes (80-200mm  slump) the Contractor shall not use the slump test as  the sole means of measuring workability or deciding  upon what level of workability to choose.  Approved  dynamic or flowability assessment methods for  measuring and controlling the workability and filling  ability of concrete delivered to the Works shall also be  used.  Suitable methods of test are given in Table  11.1.  

(3) Workability tests may be performed on a sample  obtained from the initial discharge in accordance with  CS1 provided that the workability is then determined in  duplicate.  The concrete shall be deemed to be  acceptable provided that neither result is outside the  specified range and the value reported shall then be  the average of the two determinations.

(4) At any time during the Contract the concrete plant(s)  will be subject to re-assessment by the Engineer.    Should any non-conformance be found that is likely to  jeopardise the quality of the concrete, Approval will be  withdrawn and no concrete shall be supplied to the  Works until the non-conformance is rectified.  The  Contractor shall ensure that an appropriate backup  supply of concrete is available at all times.  

(5) The Contractor shall ensure that the Engineer has free  access to the concrete plant(s) at all times, without  prior notice, to allow unannounced conformance  assessments to be made.  The Contractor shall  attend all such assessments.  

(6) Each delivery of concrete to the Works shall be  accompanied by a certificate giving full details of its  origin and composition.  The weights/volumes of  materials in each batch of concrete are to be recorded  automatically by the batching equipment and the  printed records are to be available to the Engineer.   Manually prepared records of batch composition will  not normally be acceptable to the Engineer other than  for the recording of the quantity of super p last i sizer  added on site.  

(7) When delivered to the Works, each delivery of  concrete shall be tested by the Contractor for  workability by a workability test approved by the  Engineer.  

(8) All concrete test cubes shall be 100mm for concrete  with the maximum aggregate size not exceeding  20mm and shall be 150mm with maximum aggregate  size exceeding 20mm in dimension and shall be  prepared, transported, stored and tested in  accordance with Clause 11.78 and Appendix 11.4.

(2) The Contractor shall take all necessary measures  such as appropriately designed mixes, pre-cooled  concrete, insulation, formwork materials, embedded  cooling/heating pipes and selection of appropriate pour  cycle times to ensure that after placing the concrete,  both the maximum temperature attained in the  concrete and the temperature differentials within it do  not exceed the specified levels.  

# Compliance  Testing  

# Notification of  Concreting  

11.11  The objective of the scheme of Compliance Testing in this  Specification is to ensure that the probability of  non-compliant concrete specified for the Permanent Works  will be reduced to the lowest practicable level.  

11.12  The Contractor shall give the Engineer reasonable notice of  his intention to concrete which shall in any case be in  accordance with the approved Quality Plan.  The  permission of the Engineer shall be obtained before  concrete is placed in any part of the Permanent Works.  If  placing of concrete is not started within 24 hours of  permission having been given, permission shall again be  obtained from the Engineer.

# Concrete  Trial mix  

#  

below.  Trial mixes shall not be prepared until the Engineer  has approved the Contractor's mix design proposal.  Trial  mixes shall be prepared at least 35 days before the  commencement of concreting under the supervision of the  Engineer.  For each class of concrete the following  procedure shall apply :  

(1) Three plant trial mixes shall be made at the proposed  concrete plant, each on a different day and the  workability of each mix shall be determined by either  slump, flow table, slump-flow, compacting factor, Vebe  time or other approved dynamic test.  Only one  workability test method shall be approved and used to  establish workability criteria of the concrete.  For SCC,  additional workability tests shall be performed to  demonstrate that in the design slump-flow range the  mix retains the declared properties and workability  ranges in terms of viscosity, passing ability and  segregation resistance as specified in BS EN  206:2013.  

(2) Three sub-samples shall be taken in accordance with  CS1 from each trial mix.  Each sub-sample shall be of  sufficient size to conduct the workability tests, make  two test cubes and have a minimum of 10 litres left to  form part of the workability retention sample.  Two test  cubes shall be made from each sub-sample.  One  cube from each sub-sample shall be tested at 7 days  and the other at 28 days.  

(3) A combined sample of concrete shall be retained for  workability retention testing.  The workability retention  tests shall be carried out at 30 minute intervals up to  two hours or longer if required by the Engineer.  

(4) Three sub-sample cubes from each trial mix (nine  cubes in all) shall be tested for compressive strength at  7 days and three cubes from each mix (nine cubes in  all) at 28 days.  

(5) Cubes shall be made, cured and tested in accordance  with the requirements of CS1.  The temperature at  which cubes are cured shall be  $\ensuremath{\mathcal{Z}}7\pm3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   at all times.

The  concrete sample shall fill the mould to a height of   $\mathtt{255\,\pm}$  5 mm and compacted using the method used in the  works (e.g. vibration).  If the bleeding of the concrete   $\mathsf{i s}>0.2\%$   by volume of  the sample, the Engineer may require the mix to be  re-proportioned to reduce the bleeding.  

(7) A representative sample of the concrete shall be  obtained and tested for total chloride content in  accordance with CS1.  

(8) A representative sample of the concrete shall be  obtained and tested for the fresh density of compacted  concrete in accordance with CS1.

The block shall be  instrumented with a minimum of three centrally located  thermocouples connected to an automatic data logger  and hourly readings shall be taken until the temperature  has fallen to  ${>}10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   below the peak temperature.  The  insulation of the concrete block shall be complete and  equivalent to at least   $200\,\mathsf{m m}$   of expanded polystyrene  with additional protection provided as necessary.  The  concrete block shall be constructed and instrumented  to the approval of the Engineer.  The information  gained during this test shall be used by the Contractor  in the formulation of the temperature control methods  for the mix.  The concrete block shall be retained in a  manner to ensure that damage or degradation does not  occur for a minimum of 3 months or as directed by the  Engineer.  The results of the TRET shall be used in  conjunction with the Contractor's proposed  insulation/cooling methods to evaluate compliance with  the temperature control requirements.  

(11) Category A concrete shall be tested in accordance with  CS1 “Concrete’s Ability to Resist Chloride Ion  Penetration Test” (RCPT).  The RCPT shall be  conducted on three cores taken from the TRET block at  28±1 days and tested at 35±1 days.

The library  samples shall be identified and stored by the Contractor  in such a manner that will ensure no degradation of the  material occurs during the retention period.    (2) The library samples shall be of the following minimum  weight/volume:  –   Admixture or Additives  1 litre   –   Water        1 litre   –   Aggregate      50 kg  –   Cementitious material  35 kg  

(3) The Contractor shall, in the event of a strength failure or  other non compliance, conduct tests on the library  samples at an approved independent laboratory as  directed by the Engineer.  

# Training of  Production  Personnel  

11.52  (1) All personnel shall receive training appropriate to the  duties they perform.  

(2) Concrete mixes shall be batched by operators who  have received proper instruction in the mode of  operation of the equipment used and are able to  comply with the specified accuracy of batching.  

(3) The batcher or mixer operator (whether for central or  truck mixers) is responsible for the quality and  workability of the concrete produced, and shall have  attended a suitable course and reached an acceptable  standard.  He/she shall be trained to recognize any  errors or deficiencies in the mixed concrete and be  instructed in the methods of rectifying them.  

(4) Notwithstanding the above, any operators failing to  comply with the requirements for production of concrete  shall be suspended from concrete production activities.  

Plant and  Equipment:  General  

Batching  Equipment  11.53  All plant and equipment shall be maintained in a clean and  efficient working condition and regular routine maintenance  checks shall be carried out as defined in Appendix 11.1.  

11.54  (1) Hoppers for weighing cementitious material, aggregate  and water shall consist of suitable containers freely  suspended from a scale or other suitable  load-measuring device and equipped with a suitable  discharging mechanism.    (2) The method of control of the loading mechanism shall  be such that as the quantity required in the weighing  hopper is approached, the material may be added at a  controllable rate and shut off precisely with the  weighing tolerances specified.  

(3) The weighing hoppers for cementitious material and  aggregate shall be capable of receiving their rated load  without the weighed material coming into contact with  the loading mechanism.  Additional precautions shall  be taken to ensure that the correct number of batches  is loaded into the truck mixer.  

(4) Dust seals shall be provided on cementitious material  hoppers between the loading mechanism and weighing  hopper, and shall be fitted so as to prevent the  emission of cementitious material dust without affecting  weighing accuracy.  The hopper shall be vented to  permit escape of air without emission of cementitious  material dust.  

(5) Vibrators or other attachments, where fitted, shall not  affect the accuracy of weighing.  

(6) There shall be sufficient protection to cementitious  material and aggregate weight hoppers and weighing  mechanisms to prevent interferences with weighing  accuracy by weather conditions or external build-up of  materials.  

(7) Where a continuous mixer with ribbon loading is used,  the batching procedure specified by the manufacturer  of the plant shall be followed.  

11.55  (1) The weighing and water dispensing mechanisms shall  be maintained in good order.  Their accuracy shall be  maintained within the tolerances given in Clause 11.56  and be checked against accurate weights and volumes  on a monthly basis or when required by the Engineer.  

(2) The weights of all materials as indicated by the  mechanisms employed shall be within the tolerances  stated in Clause 11.58.  

(3) Concrete shall be mixed in a power-driven batch type  mixer approved by the Engineer.  The batch capacity,  method of loading, mixing time and speed of operation  shall be as recommended by the mixer manufacturer.  

(4) Mixers which have been out of use for more than 30  minutes shall be thoroughly cleaned before any fresh  concrete is mixed.  Mixing plants shall be thoroughly  cleaned before changing from one type of cement to  another.  

(5) Cementitious materials shall only be measured by  weight and shall be weighed in a hopper or  compartment separate from those used for other  materials.  The scale increments of the weighing  device shall not exceed 5kg.  

(6) Subject to the approval of the Engineer, cement may  be measured in whole bags as delivered by the  manufacturer but only for small quantities of concrete  for minor works.  

(7) Aggregates shall be measured by weight.  The  weights of the fine and coarse aggregates shall be  adjusted to allow for the free water contained in them.   The water to be added to the mix shall be reduced by  the quantity of free water contained in the both fine and  coarse aggregates.  The method of moisture  determination shall be proposed by the Contractor for  approval by the Engineer.  The moisture shall be  measured immediately before mixing begins and then  hourly during production.   All the results shall be  recorded and submitted to the Engineer.  

(8) Admixtures and additives shall be measured by volume  or weight.  The batching plant shall be so designed  that the measured dosage of admixture or additives is  discharged into the mixing water, and is not added as a  separate concentrated solution, thereby ensuring good  distribution throughout the mix.  The exception to this  requirement is super p last i sizing admixtures, which may  be added prior to discharge from the  transporting/mixing vehicle using a method approved  by the Engineer.  

(9) It shall not be permissible for the workability of concrete  to be increased by adding water to it after it has left the  batching plant and any concrete which has had water  added to it after leaving the batching plant shall be  rejected and removed from the Site.  

(10) If the Contractor decides to reduce the water content of  future deliveries of concrete to bring the workability  within tolerance this does not release him from the  necessity of maintaining a standard deviation of  strength not exceeding 5.5 MPa for 100mm test cubes  or 5 MPa for 150mm test cubes if compliance criterion  C2 as stated in Table 11.4 is to remain in force.  

# Accuracy of   Scales and   Meters  

# Batching   System  

# Accuracy of  Batching  

(11) When assessment of the moisture content of the  aggregate is carried out continuously, using a suitable  instrument, a calibrated chart, based on the average  moisture contents of the aggregate, shall be provided  indicating the necessary changes in the added water  for each  $1\%$   change in the moisture content.    (12) When weighing materials, any build-up in the hopper  during the day must be tared out or allowed for in the  batch weights.   

 11.56  (1) The weighing and metering mechanisms shall be  calibrated within an accuracy of   ${\mathcal{Z}}^{\%}$   for all cementitious  materials, aggregates and water and within an  accuracy of   $5\%$   for admixtures and additives.    (2) Sufficient test weights shall always be available for  checking the accuracy of the scales and at least once  per month all loading-measuring mechanisms shall be  checked.   

 11.57  For all concrete mixes, the materials batch weights shall be  recorded in a computer system and readily inspected by the  Engineer if necessary.    

 11.58  The batcher operator shall measure out materials within the  following tolerances:    Cementitious   $\pm\,{\mathcal{2}}\%$   of the weight of the material in  Material    the batch, except  $0\%$   to  $+5\%$   of the  

Aggregate    $\pm\,{\mathcal{2}}\%$   of the weight of each aggregate in  the batch    Water     $\pm\,{\mathcal{2}}\%$   of the weight of water added    Admixtures   $\pm\,5\%$   of the amount to be added  

# Yield Checking   and Control  

11.59  (1) A monthly check shall be made on the yield of each mix  currently in production at the batching plant, from the  total weight of a given batch, using a weighbridge,  divided by the weight per unit volume of the fully  compacted concrete determined in accordance with  CS1.  The procedures for conducting yield checking  shall be proposed by the Contractor for the approval of  the Engineer.  

(2) Individual results of Yield checks shall be between   $98.5\%$   and   $101.5\%$   of the design value of the mix, upon  failure to meet this tolerance the mix shall be  redesigned.  Should two successive results fall below   $99\%$   or above   $101\%$   the mix shall be redesigned.  

# Washing-out   Water  

Loading   Concrete   Mixers  

11.60  Before loading concrete materials or mixed concrete into  either central or truck-type concrete mixers, any water  retained in the mixing drum for washing-out purposes must  be completely discharged.  

11.61  (1) To ensure that the concrete materials can be mixed  most readily in central and truck-type concrete mixers  into a homogenous mass, the cementitious material,  aggregates and water shall be fed into the drum  simultaneously and at a uniform rate.    (2) When mixing concrete containing CSF the CSF shall  

be added and mixed with the dry aggregates for an  agreed period prior to the introduction of the other  constituents.

11.63  (1) Where a central or plant mixer is used for the mixing of  concrete, it shall comply with Appendix 11.3, in so far  as this applies.  Central or plant mixers shall not be  loaded in excess of the manufacturer's rated capacity.  

(2) In order to produce a satisfactory mix, and where no  uniformity tests have been carried out, the mixing time  shall not be less than 2 minutes.  Where uniformity  tests have been carried out and a shorter mixing time  has been shown to be satisfactory, this time shall be  displayed on a suitable metal plate attached to the  mixer and can be adopted.    (3) When a continuous mixing plant is used for the  complete mixing of concrete, the mixing time shall be  sufficient to ensure that the concrete is of the required  uniformity.  When a continuous mixing plant is used for  the partial mixing of the concrete and the mixing is  completed in a truck mixer, the total mixing time shall  be sufficient to ensure that the concrete is of the  required uniformity.  

(1) Truck mixing or dry batching will only be permitted with  the prior approval of the Engineer and shall conform to  the Engineer's supplementary Specification for Truck  Mixed Concrete as detailed in Appendix 11.3.  When a  truck mixer is used for the partial or complete mixing of  concrete, mixing shall be considered to commence  from the moment when all the materials required for the  batch, including water, are in the rotating drum of the

Grout or water may be used to  charge the pump at the start of pumping and shall be  discharged and discarded on a suitable place outside  the form together with such amount of pumped  concrete as in the opinion of the Engineer will be  needed to ensure that the quality of the emergent  concrete is satisfactory.  Grout for charging the pump  shall be made from PC and water.  

(2) When pumping is completed, the concrete remaining in  the pipeline, if it is to be used in the Works, is to be  ejected in such a manner that there will be no  contamination of the concrete or separation of the  ingredients.  After this operation, the entire equipment  is to be thoroughly cleaned.

(2) Two cubes shall be prepared by the Contractor in  accordance with CS1 from each randomly selected  sample of concrete.  They shall be compacted using  a vibrating table as provided for in Section 7 of CS1.   Vibrating hammers or compacting bars shall not be  used.  The concrete in the mould shall be vibrated  until no further entrained air is seen to be emerging.   The vibration time shall be minimised when  compacting high workability concrete to ensure that  over compaction and segregation of the concrete does  not occur.  

Cube Tests  11.79  

(3) The compliance cube test sample shall be taken,  when practicable, at the point of discharge from the  delivery vehicle and shall be taken from the full  discharge of the load as required by CS1. 

  

 (1) A cube test result shall be defined as the average of  the compressive strength measurements made on two  cubes taken from a single sample.  

(2) If the difference between the compressive strengths of  the two cubes exceeds   $15\%$   of the test results for that  pair of cubes, then action shall be taken to ensure  that the sampling and testing procedures as required  are being followed.  If the difference between the  compressive strengths of the two cubes exceeds   $\scriptstyle{20\%}$    of the test results for that pair of cubes, then that test  results for that pair should be disregarded and  investigations shall be made to establish whether the  concrete represented by the test result is acceptable  or not.  

(1) For the purpose of this Specification two criteria are  stated, namely, C1 and C2, as stated in Table 11.4. 

  

 (2) The test results of designed mixes shall comply with  the following requirements: 

   (a) each test result shall be not less than the grade  strength minus the amount stated in column A of  Table 11.4;    (b) the average of any four consecutive test results,  or the average of 2 or 3 test results if less than 4  test results are available, shall not be less than  the grade strength plus the amount stated in  column B of Table 11.4.

$  

(3) Criterion C1 is the more rigorous of the two and shall  be applied until the Engineer is satisfied that the  quality and uniformity of the concrete supplied justifies  application of criterion C2.  

(4) If in the opinion of the Engineer, the proposed  concrete supplier can provide sufficient evidence that  his standard of quality control, using similar materials  and plant to that proposed for the work, is such that  the standard deviation for at least 40 consecutive test  results will not exceed 5.5 MPa for 100mm test cubes  or 5 MPa for 150mm test cubes, then criterion C2 may  be applied from the commencement of the work. 

   consecutive test results are available.  If the standard  deviation of these does not exceed 5.5 MPa for  100mm test cubes or 5 MPa for 150mm test cubes  then criterion C2 may be applied to all subsequent test  results.  If however the standard deviation of any 40  consecutive test results rises thereafter and exceeds  5.5 MPa for 100mm test cubes or 5 MPa for 150mm  test cubes at any time then criterion C1 shall apply to  all subsequent test results.  

(6) When the following situation occurs, no further  concrete of that mix shall be placed until the Engineer  is satisfied that control has been re-established over  the concrete production process:  

(i) For concrete grade not exceeding C60, the  standard deviation of any 40 consecutive test results  exceeds 8.5 MPa for 100mm test cubes or 8 MPa for  150mm test cubes at any time  

(ii) For concrete grade exceeding C60, the coefficient  of variation exceeds   $14\%$  

(7) If the compliance criterion is changed from C1 to C2 or  vice versa, the new compliance criterion shall apply  from the 35th day after casting the last pair of cubes in  the set of 40 on which the decision to make the  change is based.  

(8) If there is a period exceeding 14 days between the  taking of any two consecutive test results, then if  agreed by the Engineer, the test results obtained  before and immediately after the period may be  treated separately for the purpose of Clause 11.80(2b)  above.  

(9) The Engineer may instruct that additional cubes be  made to check the attained strength levels in parts of  the structure or for other particular purposes.  These  cubes shall be taken, stored and tested in a manner  directed by the Engineer.  

(10) The Contractor will be supplied with the cube test  report by the Engineer.  The Contractor shall use the  results to ascertain that correct quality control is being  maintained.  

Non-Compliance    11.81  (1) A batch of concrete shall be considered as not  complying with specified requirements for compressive  strength if any test result of concrete from the batch  does not satisfy the requirements of column A of Table  11.4.  

(2) If the average of any group of four consecutive test  results does not meet the requirements of column B of  Table 11.4 then the concrete from all the batches  which provided all the test results in that group shall be  considered as not complying with the specified  requirements for compressive strength.  

(3) If any concrete tests fail to comply with the specified  requirements for compressive strength, tests may be  made on the placed concrete to demonstrate  compliance.  The tests will entail cutting out concrete  or taking of cores, as detailed in Appendix 11.5.  

(4) Should the Engineer direct the Contractor to obtain  cores, each occurrence of an individual or running  average failure shall require a set of three cores to be  obtained from the location where the non-compliant  cube(s) were obtained, within 7 days from the  notification of the failure.  The estimated equivalent  cube strength shall be calculated in accordance with  CS1.  Conformance of the cores shall be as follows:  

(a) for any set of cores representing a test location,  the average estimated cube strength shall be at  least  $85\%$   of the specified grade; and    (b) for any set of cores representing a test location,  the individual estimated cube strength shall be at  least  $75\%$   of the specified grade.  

(5) Rejected concrete shall be removed from the Works.

(7) The force in the prestressing tendons shall not be  transferred to the concrete until it has been proven to  the satisfaction of the Engineer that the concrete has  reached the specified transfer strength.  The time for  transfer shall be determined by the successful testing  of a batch of minimum 3 test cubes.  If the initial batch  of cubes test indicates that the concrete has not  attained the required strength, a further batch of cubes  shall be tested at a later date.  This process shall be  repeated until a batch of cubes successfully passes  the strength test.  

(8) The capacity of pressure gauges, when used together  with the load cell as a load indicator, shall be sufficient  in capacity such that the working pressure lies within  the central half of the range of the gauge.  

# Pretensioning  

12.37  (1) The stress in prestressing tendons shall be fully  maintained during the period between pretensioning  and transfer of stress.  Transfer of stress shall take  place gradually to minimise shock or damage to the  transmission length and shall be carried out in  conjunction with the release of any hold-down and  hold-up forces in tendon deflectors.  

(2) In the long-line method of pretensioning, locator plates  shall be distributed throughout the length of the bed to  ensure that the steel wires or wire strands are  maintained in the correct positions during concreting.   Units which are made in line shall be free to slide in  the direction of their length to permit transfer of the  prestressing force to the concrete along the whole line.  

(3) Moulds used in the individual mould system of  pretensioning shall be sufficiently rigid to provide the  reaction to the prestressing force without distortion.  

(4) Tendon deflectors in contact with pretensioned  prestressing tendons of single steel wire or wire strand  shall have a radius of at least 5 times the prestressing  tendon diameter for steel wire and at least 10 times  the prestressing tendon diameter for wire strand.  The  total angle of deflection shall not exceed   $15^{\circ}$  .  If a  system is used such that friction develops between  prestressing tendons and tendon deflectors, the  friction force shall be determined by a test procedure  approved by the Engineer and any necessary  allowance shall be made.  

(5) The tendons shall be covered with sleeves of PVC or  other approved material where these materials are  specified as debonded from the concrete.  Tape ends  of the sleeves to the tendon shall prevent the ingress  of grout.  

(6) When the temperature of the pretensioning steel is  below   $10\mathrm{{^\circC}}$   at the time of tensioning, steel elongation  computations shall allow for the increase in  temperature of the steel between the time of  tensioning and the time when the concrete takes its  initial set.

The schedule shall  include the proposed sequence of tensioning the  prestressing tendons, the required prestressing loads  and the calculated extensions of the prestressing  tendons.  

(2) Spacers used with post-tensioned steel wire or wire  strand which are not tensioned simultaneously shall be  sufficiently rigid to ensure that they will not be  displaced during successive tensioning operations.  

(3) If both ends of the prestressing tendon are free to  move, a demonstration shall be carried out before  post-tensioning starts to show that all prestressing  tendons are free to move in the ducts.  

(4) Post-tensioning shall be carried out in such a manner  that the stress in the prestressing tendons increases at  a gradual and steady rate.  The sequence of  tensioning prestressing tendons and the ends of  prestressing tendons from which prestress will be  applied shall be as stated in the Contract or as  approved by the Engineer.  

(5) For each element of a structure being stressed,  post-tensioning of the prestressing tendons shall be  carried out until the required prestress to that element  has been reached.  Tensioning of each prestressing  tendon shall be carried out continuously until the  required tendon loads or extensions have been  reached.  If tensioning is stopped for more than  2 days, particulars of any proposals for remedial or  other work shall be submitted to the Engineer for  Approval and tensioning shall not recommence until  the approved work has been carried out.  

(6) Measurement of extensions shall not commence until  any slack in the prestressing tendon has been taken  up. If the design permits, the draw-in of prestressing  tendons at the non-jacking end shall also be  measured. The tensioning shall be applied in  increments of load and the extensions shall be  measured at each increment.  The average  measured total extension of the prestressing tendons  in each post-tensioning stage shall be within   $5\%$   of the  average calculated total extension of the  corresponding post-tensioning stage and the  measured total extension of individual prestressing  tendons in each post-tensioning stage shall be within   $10\%$   of the calculated total extension of individual  prestressing tendons of the corresponding  post-tensioning stage.  

(7) If the tendon deflector in contact with a post-tensioned  prestressing tendon has a radius of less than 50 times  the diameter of the prestressing tendon or if the total  angle of deflection exceeds   $15^{\circ}$  , the loss of strength of  the prestressing tendon shall be determined by a test  procedure approved by the Engineer and any  necessary allowance shall be made.  

(8) Post-tensioned prestressing tendons shall be cut at a  distance from the anchorage of at least one diameter  or 10mm, whichever is the greater.  Unless otherwise  permitted by the Engineer the tendons shall not be cut  until at least one day after stressing, if the tendon is to  be cut before grouting, or alternatively, at least 3 days  after grouting.  

External prestressing tendons and anchorages shall be  protected in their permanent positions from mechanical  damage or corrosion until the permanent protection is  applied.  

Contractor on the Site and a report shall be submitted to the  Engineer within 24 hours of each tensioning operation.   The report shall contain the following details:

Grout Injection  

# 12.43  

12.44  Grouting of prestressing tendons shall be effective such that  the duct is completely filled, and the prestressing tendon is  completely surrounded, with grout.  

(1) The permission of the Engineer shall be obtained  before prestressing tendons are grouted.  If grouting  is not started within 24 hours of permission having  been given, permission shall again be obtained from  the Engineer.  

(2) Grouting of the prestressing tendons shall be carried  out as soon as practicable, and not more than 5 days  after tensioning of the tendons.  

(3) Immediately before grouting starts, the ducts shall be  thoroughly washed by pumping clean water through  the ducts.  The water shall flow through all grout  vents.  Partial or complete blockage of grout vents  shall be cleared before grouting starts.  After washing,  the ducts shall be blown dry with oil-free compressed  air.  As soon as the drying is complete each duct,  vent, inlet and outlet shall be checked to ensure that  they are capable of accepting the injection of grout by  blowing the compressed air through the system.   Each vent shall be checked in turn.  

(4) Grout shall be used within 30 minutes of mixing unless  a retarder is incorporated in the grout.  If a retarder is  used, the time shall be determined by a test procedure  approved by the Engineer.  

(5) Grouting shall be undertaken by vacuum assistance.  Prior to grout injection a vacuum pump shall be  connected to the higher end of the duct to be grouted.  The grout injection shall be from the lower ends of  ducts.  With all vents closed the vacuum pump shall  be activated and run for not less than 10 minutes prior  to grout injection.  A negative pressure of 750 millibar  shall be maintained throughout the grouting.  While  maintaining the vacuum, the grout shall be pumped in  to the lower end of the duct.  The grout pressure  applied shall be as low as practicable and shall not  exceed 1 MPa.  Grout injection shall be continuous  and steady and shall be at a rate which will avoid grout  segregation and the trapping of air in the duct.  The  vacuum shall be maintained until grout is observed at  the higher end of the duct.  Grouting shall be  maintained until grout of an equivalent consistency to  the grout injected is observed flowing out of the higher  end of the duct.  After closing the higher end, grout  shall be allowed to flow from each of the grout vents  until its consistency is equivalent to that of the grout  injected.  Following this, a further 5 litres at each vent  shall be vented into a clean receptacle.   Representative samples as indicated by the Engineer  shall be tested in accordance with Clause 12.56 and  discarded.  All vents shall be closed one after another  in the direction of flow except that at intermediate  crests the vents 400mm downstream shall be closed  before their associated crest vent.  After the last grout  vent has been closed, the pressure shall be  maintained at 0.5 MPa for 5 minutes.  The injection  vent shall then be closed under pressure.  10 minutes  after the injection vent is closed the vents at all crests  in the duct profiles shall be reopened and any escape  of air, water or grout shall be recorded and  immediately reported to the Engineer to agree any  further action which may be necessary.  

(6) If there is any blockage or breakdown or if the grout  injection is interrupted, the duct shall immediately be  thoroughly washed with clean water and blown dry  with oil-free compressed air; regrouting shall start as  soon as practicable. 

  

 (7) Grouted ducts shall not be subjected to shock or  vibration within 24 hours of grouting. 

  

 (8) The level of grout in grout vents shall be inspected and  made good as approved by the Engineer.  Making  good shall not be carried out until at least 2 days after  grouting.

# Determination of the Movement of Piles by Load Test  

# Scope  

# Equipment  

19.1.1  This method covers the determination of the movement of  piles by means of a load test.  

19.1.2  The following equipment is required:  

(1)  kentledge, anchor piles or other anchorages  supported or installed at suitable locations to provide  adequate reactions against jacking; 

  

 (2)  hydraulic jacks and associated equipment; 

  

 (3)  4 deflectometers, readable and accurate to  0.025mm, and precision levelling equipment and  load measuring equipment of a type approved by the  Engineer; 

  

 (4)  a reference beam; 

  

 (5)  working platforms; 

  

 (6)  screens and protection from exposure to conditions  which may affect the test; 

  

 (7)  test loads.  

# Procedure:  Before Testing  

19.1.3  The procedure before testing shall be as follows:  

(1)  The kentledge, anchor piles or other anchorages shall  be installed.  The centre of each anchor pile shall be  at least  $_{2\,\mathsf{m}}$   or 3 times the pile diameter, whichever is  greater, from the centre of the pile to be tested and  from the centre of any adjacent pile.    (2)  If required, the pile to be tested shall be extended  from cut-off level to ground level.  The strength of  piles at joints shall not be less than any normal  section of the pile.    (3)  A temporary pile cap designed by the Contractor shall  be constructed.    (4)  Working platforms, screens and protection shall be  installed.  

(5)  The reference beam shall be set up on supports  which are at least 2 m or 3 times the pile diameter,  whichever is greater, from the test pile and anchor  pile.  

# 19.1.4  The procedure for the load test shall be as follows:  

(1)  Trial piles shall be tested to not less than twice the  working load of the pile or other loads stated in the  Contract.  Working piles shall be tested to not less  than 1.8 times working load.  Reductions for group or  boundary effects shall not be made in determining the  test loads. 

  

 (2)  Test loads shall be applied and removed in 3 stages  as stated in Table 19.1.1. 

  

 (3)  The test loads shall be applied in increments, and  removed in decrements, of  $\mathcal{Z}5\%$   of the working load.   Increments of load shall not be applied until the rate  of settlement of the pile is less than 0.1mm in  20 minutes. 

  

 (4)  The full loads for Stage I shall be applied in  increments and shall then be maintained for at least  24 hours after the rate of settlement has reduced to  less than 0.1mm per hour.  The test loads shall be  removed in decrements and the recovery of the pile  recorded before loading is resumed. 

  

 (5)  The procedure stated in Clause 19.1.4(4) shall be  repeated for Stage II loading. 

  

 (6)  The full loads for Stage III shall be applied in  increments and shall be maintained for the greater  of : 

   (a) 24 hours after the rate of movement has been  reduced to less than 0.1mm/hour; or 

   (b) 72 hours; 

   After Stage III, the test load shall be removed and the  recovery of the pile shall be determined. 

  

 (7)  The settlement of the pile shall be measured at hourly  intervals or other intervals permitted by the Engineer.   The settlement of the pile under each increment and  decrement of loading shall be measured.  The exact  times at which increments are applied and  decrements are removed shall be recorded in the  presence of the Engineer.  

(8)  The level of the reference beam shall be checked at  regular intervals as permitted by the Engineer during  the test.

# Procedure  

20.1.3  The procedure shall be as follows:  

(1)  The PTFE surface of the bearing shall be lubricated  with the lubricant. 

  

 (2)  Two sets of sliding surfaces shall be mounted back to  back between the platens of the compression testing  rig with the stainless steel sliding surfaces in the  centre.  A vertical load equal to the permanent load  stated in the schedule of bearings shall be applied for  1 hour. 

  

 (3)  A horizontal load shall then be applied steadily and  without shock to the pair of stainless steel sliding  surfaces and shall be increased at a rate of   $0.2\%$   of  the vertical load per minute until movement occurs  between the sliding surfaces.  The maximum  horizontal load sufficient to cause movement of at  least 25mm between the stainless steel and PTFE  sliding surfaces at a rate not exceeding 50mm/min  shall be recorded. 

  

 (4)  The loads shall be removed.  

(5)  The sliding surfaces shall be removed from the rig  and inspected.  

# Calculation

(2) The test loads shall then be applied in increments.    (3) The rate of loading shall be slow enough to avoid any  adverse shock effects.    (4) The maximum load shall be maintained until any  obvious short-term creep has ceased.    (5) The load shall then be removed in decrements.    (6) Load deflection measurements shall be made at each  increment and decrement.  

20.2.3  For serviceability limit state load tests:  

(1) After complete unloading, the amount of set shall be  

checked and, if significant, the loading and unloading  cycle repeated. If the set is shown to be progressive,  the bearing shall be deemed not to comply with the  requirements.  

(2) After being tested, the bearing shall be dismantled as  necessary for inspections  

(3) A bearing is considered to have passed a serviceability  limit state load test provided that there is no visible  damage or permanent deformation of any part due to  loading cycles subsequent to the initial bedding-in  cycle.  

# Ultimate and limit    20.2.4  For ultimate limit state load tests:  state load tests  

(1) Where a bearing is to be test loaded to both  serviceability and ultimate limit states, it shall be tested  for serviceability first and be dismantled as necessary  for inspection before being tested for the ultimate limit  state. In such cases, it shall have a second bedding-in  cycle before the second load test. 

  

 (2) A bearing may be considered to have passed an  ultimate limit state load test if it supports the test load. 

  

 (3) Bearings tested for the ultimate limit state shall not be  further used.
