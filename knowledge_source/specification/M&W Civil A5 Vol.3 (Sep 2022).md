# Trial Soil Nail:    22.30  Pull-out Test  Procedure  

A minimum of 3 soil nails shall be subject to Pull-out tests  prior to the installation of Works soil nails as directed by the  Engineer. The following procedure shall be adopted.  

(1) Site preparation:  

(a)  the test site or sites shall be selected by the  Engineer to ensure that soil conditions are  representative of those in which the nails are to  operate;    (b)  holes shall be drilled to length and at locations  as specified in the Drawings.  The hole  alignment shall be  $\mathcal{Z}0^{\circ}$   below horizontal   $(\pm5^{\circ})$  ;    (c)  drillholes and nails shall be inspected by the  Engineer before installation to ensure that they  conform to the specification;    (d)  the loading equipment shall be assembled,  taking care to ensure that the direction of pull is  axial to the bar, that the equipment sits firmly  on the slope face, and that no part of the bar or  any grout column will interfere with the  application or measurement of the load during  the test;  

(2) Soil nails for pull-out tests shall be installed and  tested prior to the installation of permanent soil nails.  The number of pull-out tests shall be as shown on  the Drawings or as instructed by the Engineer. Soil  nails subjected to pull-out tests shall not form part of  the permanent works. The details of the testing  arrangement including the set-up and support for the  testing apparatus shall be submitted for the  Engineer’s approval. The apparatus for measuring  loads and deformations shall have an accuracy of 5  kN and 0.05 mm respectively. The apparatus for  measuring  deformation  shall  be  capable  of  measuring a displacement of up to 50 mm. The  apparatus shall be tested and calibrated by approved  laboratories not more than 6 months prior to the date  of carrying out the tests. Test and calibration  certificates shall be submitted to the Engineer at  least one week before the test. Drilling records of  holes selected for pull-out tests shall be provided to  the Engineer within 24 hours of drilling. The following  procedure shall be adopted: -  

(a) The loading apparatus shall be set up in such a  way that no loading, other than the pull-out load,  acts on the steel bar at the nail head. The  reaction of the pull-out load from the loading  apparatus shall act on a sufficiently sized rigid  bearing plate placed against a temporary cut  face at normal to the alignment of the steel bar to  ensure adequate load spreading and to avoid  eccentric loading.  Monitoring instruments shall  be carefully positioned and independently  supported to record the extension of the soil nail  steel bar and any movement of the steel bearing  plate.  

(b) The soil nail shall be grouted over the length as  specified in the Drawings or as directed by the  Engineer. The length to be grouted shall be  isolated by means of a packer that can prevent  grout from leaking through to the free-length  section during grouting and that can ensure that  the proposed bonded section is effectively  grouted to the required length as shown in the  Drawings. The entire free length of the steel bar  shall be properly debonded or capped to ensure  that the test load can be directly transferred to  the bonded zone in case of grout leak through  the packer. The pull-out test shall not be carried  out until the grout has reached a cube strength of  21 MPa.  

(c) The maximum test load shall be either   $90\%$   of  the yield load of the steel bar of the test nail (Tp)  or the ultimate soil/grout bond load (Tult).  

(d) The test nail shall be loaded in stages: from the  initial load (Ta) via two intermediate test loads  (TDL1 and TDL2) to the maximum test load.  TDL1 and TDL2 are the loads that result in the  bonded zone tested to allowable pull-out  resistance and the allowable pull-out resistance  times the factor of safety against pull-out failure  at soil-grout interface respectively. Ta shall be  equal to TDL1 or   $5\%$   of   $\mathsf{T p}$  , whichever is  smaller. All loadings including Ta, TDL1, TDL2  and Tp shall be specified in the Drawings or as  directed by the Engineer.  

(e) During the first two loading cycles, the  intermediate loads, TDL1 and TDL2, shall be  maintained for 60 minutes for deformation  measurement. After the measurement has been  completed, the load shall be reduced to Ta and  the residual deformation shall be recorded. In  the last cycle, the test load shall be increased  gradually from Ta straight to maximum test load  and then maintained for deformation  measurement. The measurement at each of the  cycles shall be taken at time intervals of 1, 3, 6,  10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 minutes. The test nail  is considered to be able to sustain the test load  if the difference of nail movements at 6 and 60  minutes does not exceed 2mm or   $0.1\ \%$   of the  grouted length of the test nail. In this case, the  test shall proceed to the next loading cycle or be  terminated if the test nail is subject to TP.  

(f)  If the nail fails to sustain the test load TDL1,  TDL2 or Tp, the test shall be terminated and the  nail movement against residual load with time  shall be recorded.  The measurements shall be  taken at time intervals of 1, 3, 6, 10 and every  10 minutes thereafter over a period for at least  two hours. Where required the measurements  shall be continued and at intervals as directed  by the Engineer.  

(g) Throughout the test, the soil nail movement  versus the applied load shall be measured,  plotted on a graph and recorded along with all  other relevant information. All the results shall  be submitted to the Engineer within 3 days of  completion of the test.  

(h)  Where required, the whole soil nail shall be  pulled out from the drillhole for the Engineer’s  inspection. Where the steel bar remains in-situ  after the pull-out test, the bar shall be cut-off  flush with the finished ground and the remaining  part of the drillhole grouted.  

# Soil Nail Heads  

(1) Soil-nail heads shall be constructed in accordance  with the details as specified in the Contract. A  method statement for the construction of soil nail  heads shall be submitted for the Engineer’s  agreement. 

  

 (2) The threads at the top end of soil nail bars shall be  thoroughly cleaned, properly treated with  galvanized coating or protected with approved  zinc-rich paint prior to construction of soil nail  heads. 

  

 (3) Steel reinforcement for soil nail heads shall be of  grade 460 steel and comply with CS2  requirements. Concrete for soil nail heads shall be  Grade 30/20 concrete or 30 MPa sprayed concrete  and comply with Sections 8 and 11 of this  Specification.  

(4) Concreting of soil-nail heads shall be carried out in  a manner which ensures that the placed concrete  is adequately compacted. Unless agreed otherwise  by the Engineer, concreting of soil-nail heads using  sprayed concrete shall be applied in two stages,  allowing the bearing plate to be positioned firmly  against the first stage concrete. The method  statement as referred to in sub-clause (1) of this  Clause shall include proposal for the construction  sequence of 2-stage sprayed concrete soil nail  heads. Trial runs shall also be conducted to  demonstrate to the Engineer that the proposed  method statement will produce satisfactory results  and the rebound of sprayed concrete material is  minimal.  

(5) Any temporary excavation for constructing soil nail  heads, including overbreaks shall be backfilled with  Grade 30/20 concrete, 30 MPa sprayed concrete  or other material as agreed by the Engineer.  

(6) Where instructed by the Engineer, a maximum of 3  concreted soil-nail heads shall be uncovered from  the batch of soil nail heads cast on any one day at  any site for examination of the quality of soil-nail  heads. If defective workmanship is identified in any  one of the uncovered soil-nail heads, the whole  batch of soil nail heads cast on the same day at  that site shall be deemed to be defective. All the  remaining soil nail heads cast on the same day at  that site shall be broken up for the Engineer’s  examination. The soil-nail heads shall be recast  and re-examined to the satisfaction of the  Engineer.

Open Hole   Drilling  

# Odex Drilling  

#  

Rock, or Artificial hard Material without the recovery of  cores or samples, shall be advanced, if instructed by the  Engineer, by means of a tricone roller bit, drag bit or other  non-coring bit with water as the flushing medium.The drilling  technique may be used for probing for boulders, forming  holes rapidly for the installation of instruments, forming  inclined holes for the installation of drains, or for advancing  holes rapidly.  

24.10  Where the materials encountered are considered to be  unstable the Engineer may instruct the use of the Odex  drilling method.  This will require the use of top-hammers  to advance bit and casing tubes at the same time.  Where  Odex drilling is employed the casing tubes, or approved  equivalent, shall be left in the drillhole to enable drilling to  

continue with conventional core barrels as far as possible.   Consistent pressures and rotation speeds should be used  with rotary percussive drilling.  The Contractors shall  accurately measure and record the rate of penetration with  this method of drilling.  The method of measurement of  penetration rate will be to the approval of the Engineer.   With consistent pressures and rotation speeds the  measurement of the rate of penetration can generally be  achieved by timing, with a stop watch, the passage of a  fixed point on the drillrods over a unit distance which can  vary from 0.15m to   $1.0\mathsf{m}$  .  The  Final Report  shall include a  graphical record of rate of penetration against depth for  each rotary percussive drillhole, if required by the Engineer.  Changes in any drilling parameters such as bit pressure or  gearing and the like, shall be recorded and presented with  the penetration record for the drillhole.  

Rotary Core    24.11  Drilling  

(1) Rotary core drilling through rock shall normally be  carried out to produce cores not less than 54mm in  diameter using diamond tipped or tungsten carbide  drill bits and a double tube ball bearing swivel type  core barrel which can be adapted to include an  additional expendable triple tube plastic or approved  liner when required by the Engineer.  

(2) A single drill run shall not exceed 1.5m in length  except when so directed by the Engineer.  The core  barrel shall be withdrawn from the hole and the core  removed as often as may be necessary to secure the  highest possible core recovery and quality.  

(3) If the core recovery is less than the minimum core  recovery in any core run as specified for the Category  of Drilling in the type of materials and the Engineer is  satisfied that a conscientious attempt has been made,  using appropriate equipment and correct procedures,  to obtain the maximum possible core recovery,  subsequent run shall be reduced by   $50\%$  , to a  minimum length of   $0.5\,\mathsf{m}$  . 

  

 (4) If at any time a blocking of the bit or grinding of the  core is indicated the core barrel shall be immediately  withdrawn from the borehole regardless of the length  of run which has been made. 

  

 (5) The length of each drill run and the actual length of  core recovered in each drill run shall be recorded.   The actual length of core in fractured or jointed rock  shall be determined by reconstructing the core.   Where the core run is terminated by an angled fracture  or joint the actual length of the core recovered shall be  measured to the mid length of that fracture or joint.  

(6) The Contractor shall have available on site for use in  soft or friable formations Craelius ‘T' series core  barrels or WM series core barrels to BS 4019: Core  drilling equipment, Part 1: 1974 Basic equipment,  equivalent double tube swivel type core barrels with  face discharge bits.

(2) The weight of the drilling rig shall be compatible with  the maximum hydraulic thrust required for the  appropriate hole diameter, without movement of the  rig.  As a guide, the working hydraulic thrust applied  to the drilling bit during drilling works for the Mid Levels  Study was of the order of   $1\small{,}000\mathsf{k N}/\mathsf{m}^{2}$  to   $\mathsf{2,750k N m}^{\mathsf{z}}$  .   Drilling rigs shall not weigh less than about 12kN.  

(3) If the weight of the rig is insufficient to prevent  movement, the base of the rig shall be securely  anchored down or loaded.  

(4) Drilling rigs shall be capable of providing stable  drill-string rotation at speeds in the range 50rpm to  1250rpm and have a minimum ram stroke length of  600mm.  The rigs shall also be filled with a  tachometer and a hydraulic feed pressure gauge, both  of appropriate scales.  A rigid rod, clearly graduated  in 10mm increments shall be permanently attached to  and parallel with the hydraulic feed rams, to provide a  means of measuring penetration and estimating  penetration rates.

(a)  establishment of a permanent reference marker  not more than  $0.5\mathsf{m}$   distant from the drill hole.   Where possible the reference marker shall be a  concrete cube of side   $0.3\mathsf{m}$   with its upper  surface at ground level.  Where this is not  possible, e.g. on pavements, a permanent  reference mark shall be established on the  existing ground surface; 

  

 (b)  establishment of a temporary reference marker  on the drilling rig as close as possible to the drill  hole axis.  

(c)  daily measurement of vertical distance between  temporary and permanent markers; 

  

 (d)  taping of drill hole depth relative to temporary  marker using an approved metric tape before  and after each core run; 

  

 (e)  measurement and calculation of drill hole depth  relative to temporary marker after each core run  by summing the total length of core barrel and  drill rods; 

  

 (f)  reduction of all drill hole depth measurements to  depth below permanent concrete marker; 

  

 (g)  adoption of a technique to ensure drill rods are  always centralized within the drill chuck; 

  

 (h)  ensure drill position is maintained such that the  drill rods remain central within the drill hole; 

  

 (i)  restriction of drill run length to a maximum of one  ram stroke unless drilling in solid rock of Grade I  to III, i.e. no re-chucking; 

  

 (j)  restriction of the flush medium flow rate to the  minimum required for the maintenance of  reasonable progress; 

  

 (k)  immediate removal of non-retractable core  barrels on change of materials from hard to soft  and replacement with retractable core barrel  (vice versa for soft to hard); 

  

 (l)  in water flush holes when a retractable core  barrel is in use, completing the final 50mm of  each run without water; 

  

 (m)  smooth removal of drilling rods and core barrel  from the drill hole; 

  

 (n)  hosing out of core barrel and sediment catcher  after each core run; 

  

 (o)  advancement of casing by a rotary action,  without surging;  

(p)  avoidance of casing advancement beyond the  depth penetrated by the core barrel;  

(q)  ensuring that all equipment and components are  maintained in a good, clean, lubricated condition  and otherwise maintained in accordance with  manufacturers' instructions.  For MLC core  barrels this should include the replacement of  the extrusion piston using a loading device and  the carrying out of frequent checks on the ball  valves and extrusion tests to check leakage past  the piston.  

(2) Should the Contractor fail to ensure that drilling,  sampling and testing are undertaken as specified, then  he may be liable to redrill part off all of the hole at his  own expense should the Engineer direct.  

# Drilling   Sequence  

Cleaning Hole  Before  Sampling  or SPT Test  

Marking of Holes  

# Backfilling and  Making Good  

24.22  Holes shall be carried out in the sequence specified or as  required by the Engineer.  

24.23  Before an undisturbed sample is taken or SPT is carried  out, all loose material and material disturbed by drilling or  in-situ tests shall be removed from the sides and bottom of  the hole.  On recommencement of work, at least a further  300mm of soil shall be removed before the next undisturbed  sample is taken or SPT is carried out unless the Engineer  directs otherwise.  All sampling and SPT testing must be  done below the level of casing where it is being used.  

24.24  Where by the Engineer, the position of holes shall be  permanently marked by concrete markers of not less than   $0.3\mathsf{m}$   in any dimension.  The reference number of the  holes shall be clearly inscribed and underlined in the fresh  concrete and the top face of the marker shall be painted  white, after the concrete has set.  

(1) No holes shall be backfilled until directed by the  Engineer.  All holes other than trial pits and sounding  holes shall be backfilled with grout which shall consist  of bentonite mixed with cement in the proportion 1 to 4  by weight with no more water than is necessary to  permit the grout to flow or be pumped.  The grout  shall contain an approved expanding agent such as  aluminum powder in a proportion approved by the  Engineer.  The grout shall be fed into the bottom of  the hole by a tremie pipe, the end of which shall  always be below the top level of the grout whilst  grouting is being carried out.  

(2) The Contractor shall submit proposals for backfilling  horizontal holes detailing his intended method and  materials to the Engineer for his approval. 

  

 (3) In agricultural and/or park areas backfilling shall be  stopped one meter below the original ground level and  the remaining depth of the hole shall be filled with dry  topsoil rammed hard. 

  

 (4) Any subsequent depression of the original ground  surface which the Engineer determines to have been  caused by the Contractors methods of investigation  shall be backfilled, made good and compacted by the  Contractor at no extra cost to the Employer. 

  

 (5) In accordance with the Conditions of Contract, the  Contractor shall be responsible for the adequacy of the  backfilling and other making good until the expiry of  the Maintenance Period.  

Storage  of Cores on Site  and  Removal of  Cores from Site  

Core Logging   and  Descriptions  

# Working Over  

24.26  Until the boxes containing the cores are transported from  the site they shall be neatly stored at the drillhole locations  in such a manner that inspection of the cores can easily be  made.  The boxes shall be stored under cover and  protected from the weather, to the satisfaction of the  Engineer.  All core boxes shall be carefully transported to  avoid damage and disturbance to the contents.  All boxes  containing cores shall be transported to a temporary core  store not later than 72 hours after completion of the  drillhole.

(2) The personnel for marine work shall include an  experienced Marine Supervisor who will be  responsible for the safe moving and movement of  marine craft and equipment required for this work.  

(3) Where drilling over water, all depths shall be  measured from the initial submerged ground level  which shall be a fixed referenced datum to Principal  Datum level.  

(4) Works over water must adhere to all Marine  Department regulations and the Contractor shall  ensure that his plant and method of working shall not  cause an obstruction.  

(5) The Contractor shall ensure that, during over water  boring and drilling operations, the craft or structure  supporting the plant is adequately secured against  movement from tidal, wind, current or other effects.   Should the Contractor employ a tower or staging for  making over boreholes he shall ensure that the effects  of settlement of the tower or staging are allowed for in  any measurement.  

# 24.29  

(1) Where the survey of drillholes is required the  Contractor shall survey the inclination and orientation  of any drillhole within 10m from MTR tunnels using a  drillhole survey device capable of producing a  continuous printed or photographic record.  This  instrument shall be lowered down the drill hole through  depths where measurements of inclination and  orientation are to be made.  

(2) Three copies of the results of the survey shall be  forwarded to the Engineer within 3 days of completion  of the survey.  Prints of the inclination survey record  shall be included in the final report.  

24.30  (1) Inclined or horizontal drillholes shall be drilled at the  required bearings, inclinations and coordinates.  The  maximum allowable deviation from specified  orientation for vertical holes shall be 1.5 degrees, for  inclined holes shall be 2.5 degrees, and for horizontal  holes shall be plus or minus 4 degrees in the  horizontal and vertical planes.  The maximum  allowable deviation applies over a survey interval of  20m.  

(2) Drillhole surveys will be conducted in accordance with  Clause 24.29.  Where deflections are greater than  allowable the Contractor shall take appropriate  measures to reduce the discrepancy to the satisfaction  of the Engineer.  If in the Engineer's opinion it is  necessary to abandon the drillhole because of  deviation, the Engineer may require redrilling of the  drill hole.

# General  

# Approval of  Equipment  

Numbering of  Samples  

# Labelling   Samples  

Large   Disturbed  Sample  

# Open Drive  Undisturbed  Samples  

boreholes each sample shall contain not less than  380mm net length   $(85\%$   recovery) of undisturbed  

material.  

(2) Undisturbed samples of cohesive soil shall be taken in  an approved 102mm (for U100) or 78mm (for U76)  diameter open drive sample tube made from thin  walled seamless cadmium plated steel or stainless  steel not less than 450mm in length fitted with a cutting  shoe tapered at an angle not exceeding 20 degrees.   The end-area ratio of the sample tube shall not exceed   $\mathcal{Z}5\%$   and inside clearance between the shoe and each  tube shall not exceed   ${\mathcal{Z}}^{\%}$   unless a core retainer is  used, in which case the inside clearance shall not  exceed  $4\%$  .  The adaptor head shall be fitted with a  ball valve to permit the exit of air or water during  driving and to assist in retaining the sample during  withdrawal and it shall have an allowance for  over-driving.  Each sample tube shall have a unique  reference number and the word "TOP" engraved on its  exterior at one end.  The internal and external  diameter of the cutting shoe and of the sample tube  shall be recorded.  

(3) Where undisturbed samples are taken in Common  Ground of low cohesion such as silts and silty fine  sands where driven undisturbed samples the  Contractor shall provide a core retainer of suitable  design to improve sample recovery.  In cohesive  Common Ground the initial attempt to obtain an  undisturbed sample shall be made without the use of a  core retainer.  If recovery is below the specified  minimum, then the second attempt (refer to Clause  24.42) shall use a core retainer.  

(4) The sample tube and cutting shoe shall be free from  rust, pitting, burring or any other defect.  The use of  oil inside the sampler shall be limited to the minimum  practicable.  The end of the sample tube marked  "TOP" shall be driven uppermost.  Care shall be  taken to ensure that the sample is not compressed by  over-driving.  Any sample the Engineer deems has  been compressed by overdriving shall be resampled  by the Contractor at his own expense.  The  dimensions, construction and condition of each  sample tube, cutting shoe and adaptor head shall be  approved by the Engineer prior to sampling.  

(5) Precautions shall be taken to ensure that there is no  change in moisture content and the dimensions of the  samples after they have been obtained.  Any space  between samples and end caps shall be sealed and  packed and secure air-tight end caps fitted.  

(6) All recovered samples shall be stored and transported  vertically, in the correct orientation, in purpose-built  racks which shall hold the tubes securely, preventing  movement, impact and excessive vibration.  

# Open Drive  Sampling in  Boreholes  

# 24.39  

(1) The sampler shall be driven by means of a jarring link  (i.e. the rods delivering the impact at the adaptor head  of the sampler).  The number of blows used and the  total depth driven shall be recorded.  Alternatively, in  sensitive soils, driving by an approved jacking method  shall be used in which case the rate of jacking shall be  recorded.  

(2) When a sample is not recovered in a first attempt to  take an undisturbed sample, core catchers shall be  used in the sample tube for the second sampling  attempt.  

# Piston   Samples

The piston sampler shall be capable of  operating to a minimum depth of 20m below existing  ground level and no lateral movement must be allowed  during the sampling operation.  The design and  maintenance of the sampler shall be such that a  vacuum is formed over the retained sample in the  tube. The thin-walled tube shall have a diameter of  75mm or 100mm and length of 1000mm.  The area  ratio of the tube should not exceed   $10\%$   with a cutting  edge taper angle not exceeding   $15\%$  .  Inside  clearance shall be  $0\%$  .  

(2) Unless otherwise instructed, the piston sampler shall  be required in silt and clay strata. 

  

 (3) The design and performance of the sampler shall be  such that a vacuum is formed over the retained  sample in the tube. 

  

 (4) Where the condition of soil stratum permits, the  minimum recovery shall be 900mm in any piston  sampling.  The samples shall be sealed and labelled  as specified in Clause 24.43.  

(5) The samples shall then be placed upright in pairs in a  watertight container of sound robust timber  construction with polystyrene foam lining and partition  to restrain individual samples from movement.  The  lid of the container shall be fitted with metal hinges,  hasp and staple and a locking device and rope strands  shall be attached to the top portion of the container for  lifting.  All containers shall be carefully transported to  avoid disturbance and damage to the contents.  

(6) Immediately after taking a piston sample, a hand vane  shear test shall be performed on the top and bottom of  the sample.  The hand vane equipment shall be used  with extension rods if necessary so that the test can be  performed in the sample tube even when recovery is  poor.  The result obtained shall be reported on  preliminary and final borehole logs and incorporated  into sample descriptions.  

Withdrawing  the  Samplers  

Recovery of  Undisturbed  Samples  

24.41  The rotation of sample tubes to assist removal is not  permitted.  The sample tube should be left in place to allow  the development of sufficient adhesion inside the tube.   The sampler shall then be withdrawn smoothly so as to  cause the minimum disturbance to the sample.  The total  length of the sample shall be measured and recorded and if  any of the soil has fallen out of the bottom of the tube, this  fact shall also be recorded.  

24.42  Where an attempt has been made to take an undisturbed  (and/ or relatively undisturbed) sample in a drillhole or a  trial pit, and the length of sample recovered is less than  that specified, the following shall apply:  

(1)  If a sample in a drillhole recovers less that the  specified minimum, the drillhole shall immediately be  cleared of material disturbed by the sampling  process, and another attempt shall be made from the  level of the base of the failed attempt. Should the  second attempt also prove unsuccessful, then the  drillhole shall be immediately cleared of material  disturbed by the sampling process, and the  Contractor shall perform a Standard Penetration Test  with liner from the level of the base of the second  failed attempt, and shall then continue with the  sampling sequence specified. The Engineer shall be  informed immediately if the second attempt fails. If  two consecutive sequences of failed sampling occur  in any one drillhole, drilling and sampling shall stop,  and the Engineer immediately informed. Drilling and  sampling may not resume until agreed by the  Engineer.  

(2) If a sample in a trial pit recovers less than the  specified minimum, a second attempt shall be made  beside the first, but not closer than two diameters  equivalent distance of the sampler being used.  Should the second attempt also prove unsuccessful,  then a third and final attempt shall be made. The  Engineer shall be immediately informed if the third  attempt fails.  

Sealing and  Labelling of  Undisturbed  Samples  

# 24.43  

(1) After removing the cutting shoe and the adaptor head  with the undisturbed material which they contain, the  visible ends of the sample shall each be trimmed of  any disturbed soil, and the edges chamfered at 45  degrees.  After cleaning the sides of the tube, the  ends shall be coated with three successive thin films of  just molten micro crystalline wax or other similar  material approved by the Engineer.

(3) As core is extruded it shall be arranged in core boxes  in a proper sequence starting with the shallowest core  on the left side nearest the hinge and then working  along the slat and subsequently outwards towards the  hasp (i.e. from left to right with the box lid on the far  side of the box as the core is placed).  Slats shall be  positioned and secured such that the core is restrained  from the movement.  

(4) Cores from triple tube barrels with continuous plastic  liners shall be carefully removed from the core barrel,  and sealed and labelled as specified in Clauses 24.43  and 24.47 respectively.  Cores from split-inner tube  triple tube core barrels shall be wrapped in silver foil  and carefully transferred into split plastic piping of the  same internal diameter as the split inner tubes.  The  top half of the plastic pipe shall then be placed on top  of the core and the piping completely sealed with  adhesive tape and placed in core boxes.  

(5) Fractured rock shall be packed securely.  At no time  should any core be loose in the box.

# PART 4 : CONE PENETRATION TESTING  

# Preamble  

Static Cone  Penetration Test  (CPT)  

# Apparatus  

24.94  This section describes methods for determining the  penetration resistance of soil using continuous penetration  of a precalibrated cone.  These are empirical methods of  estimating the strength of soil at various depths below  ground level.  There are two main testing methods; the  static test and the dynamic test.  The Specification should  be read in conjunction with BS1377.  Figures from this  specification are referred to here and included in Appendix  24.3.  

24.95  This method covers the determination of the resistance of  soils in-situ to the continuous penetration at a uniform rate  of a series of push rods having a fixed   $60^{\circ}$   cone at the base  and friction sleeve.  The aims of the test are to measure  continuously (or at selected depth intervals) the penetration  resistance of the cone, the local friction resistance on a  friction sleeve, and pore pressure in the vicinity of the cone  and sleeve.  

24.96  (1) The complete apparatus, known as the Penetrometer,  shall consist of the part described in (1) to (7).  

(a) The penetrometer tip shall comprise a cylindrical  body which is mounted on the lower end of the  push rods.  The tip shall contain:  (i)  the pointed steel cone at the base with an  apex angle of   $60^{\circ}$   and a base diameter of  35.6mm to give a projected area of   $1000{\mathrm{mm}}^{2}$  ;    (ii)  a tubular steel sleeve located above the  base of the cone which constitutes a friction  sleeve with an external peripheral area of   $1500\mathsf{m m}^{2}$  ;    (iii) a porous element which shall be provided to  allow measurement of soil pore water  pressure;  (iv) load cells to measure cone end resistance  and local sleeve friction;    (v)  a pressure transducer in order to measure  pore water pressure;  

(vi) an inclinometer which shall be provided to  measure the verticality of the cone during  testing.  

(b) The axes of the cone friction sleeve, and the  body of the penetrometer tip shall be coincident.  

(c)  The diameter of the penetrometer tip shall  nowhere be 0.3mm smaller or 1mm large than  the diameter of the base of the cone.  In the  case of a penetrometer tip with a friction sleeve,  no part of the penetrometer tip shall project  beyond the sleeve diameter.  Seals shall be  fitted at the end of the sleeve and at the base of  the cone to prevent entry of soil particles.  

(d) The gap width between base of cone and base of  friction sleeve shall not exceed 5mm except  when occupied by another sensor in which case  the overall width, including the sensor, shall not  exceed 15mm.  The external diameter, except  where seals are fitted, shall correspond to the  diameter of the cone base.  

(2) The sensing devices for measuring the cone and  frictional resistance shall be constructed in such a way  that possible eccentricity of these resistances cannot  influence the readings.  The sensing device fitted to  the cone shall measure only the axial force imposed  on the cone by the soil below it.  The device fitted to  the friction sleeve shall measure only shear stresses  and not normal stresses.  Electronic sensors shall be  temperature-compensated.  

(3) The Piezometric Pressure Transducer may be  measured at the penetrometer tip or immediately  above the cone shoulder.  The sensor shall be  capable of measuring water pressure to an accuracy  of  $\pm0.2\mathsf{m}$   of water and shall be protected against the  entry of soil particles by a ceramic filter mounted flush  with the sides or face of the cone as appropriate.  It  should be noted that the position and type of  piezometric sensor has not been specified as these  will vary according to what is to be measured and the  soil type.  Two sensors at different locations may be  required.  

(4) Push rods shall consist of steel cylindrical tubes, each  1m nominal effective length, screwed or attached  together to bear against each other, and with sufficient  wall thickness, to form a rigid-jointed series with a  continuous straight axis.  The push rods shall be  checked after every test in ground conditions known to  be conducive to rod bending, e.g. large depths of very  soft soils over hard layers, or soils containing  cemented zones or coarse material.  Rods with  excessive deflections shall not be reused until  straightened.  

(5) A ring, fixed on the outside of the push rods, with an  external diameter larger than the base of the cone,  may be used to reduce soil friction acting on the push  rods.  The position of this ring on the push rods shall  be more than 400mm above the base of the cone and  at least 200mm above the top of the friction sleeve.  

(6) Direct readings of the resistance of the cone and local  friction sleeve (if fitted), and of the piezometric sensor  (if fitted) shall be calibrated and available individually  for display throughout a test and shall supplement tape  or other recording techniques where provided.  

(7) The thrust machine shall be constructed such that:  

(a)  the reaction providing the thrust does not  influence the resistance, by having the screw  anchors or ballast supports at a sufficient  distance from the push rods;    (b)  the machine shall not move relative to the soil  surface by more than 0.5mm per kN of thrust  during the pushing action;    (c)  the machine shall be capable of a continuous  thrust stroke of at least 1m;    (d)  the rate of penetration during driving of the  penetrometer tip shall be capable of being  controlled at a rate of 20 ±5mm/s and thereafter  maintained at a constant rate during the entire  stroke even if readings are taken intermittently;    (e)  Means shall be provided to thrust the push rods  vertically into the ground and when necessary  provide support for the push rod guides.  

(1) The principle to be followed for CPT testing shall be  that of continuous testing in which the resistance  measurements are made while all elements of the  penetrometer tip are moving downwards  simultaneously and at the standard rate of penetration.  The type of piezocone penetrometer used shall be  such that the maximum sensitivity and resolution is  achieved.  The type of cone to be used at each  location shall be agreed with the Engineer prior to  testing.  

(2) The following pretest check inspections shall be  carried out before each test and defective items of  apparatus shall be replaced with others in sound  condition:  

(a)  Push rods; stand the push rod vertically, spin it,  and observe whether it wobbles while it is  rotating.  If there is wobble discard the rod or  check it for compliance with Clause 24.94(4).    (b)  Cone and friction sleeve; check that the wear  does not exceed the permitted tolerances (see  Clause 24.94(1)).    (c)  Seals between different elements of the  penetrometer tip.  Check for wear and remove  any particles of soil present that might interfere  with the measurement.    (d)  Electric cable for signal transmission from the  penetrometer tip.  Check for sound outer cover  and ensure it is already threaded through  sufficient push rods not to affect continuous  testing.  

(3) In order to obviate disturbance, the test position shall  be located at least 1m from previously performed cone  penetration tests not more than 10m deep or at least  1.5m where the depth exceeded 10m, or 25 borehole  diameters from previous boreholes.  

(4) Ensure that there is full saturation of the filter and other  spaces of the measuring system prior to each test.   Saturation of the filter element with silicon oil or  glycerine shall be used to reduce re-entry of air prior to  penetrating below the water table.  

(5) Erect the thrust machine to provide thrust on the push  rods in as near a vertical direction as practicable.   The maximum deviation of the thrust direction from the  vertical shall not exceed   ${\mathcal{Z}}^{\%}$  .  

(6) After joining the penetrometer tip to the leading push  rod place them in the machine so that their axis  coincides with the thrust direction.  

(7) Complete each penetration test in one continuous  operation to the full depth required.  Record the  duration of abnormal delays beyond 30 min at the  depths to which they correspond.  Stoppages in  which the delay exceeds 2 hours shall mean that the  test is completed at that depth and a separate one  shall be used if a greater depth is to be tested.  

(8) A screen display or pen recorder shall be used to  provide a continuous real time graphical record of  cone and friction sleeve resistance and pore water  pressure during the test.  Numerical values of cone  and friction sleeve resistance and pore water pressure  shall also be recorded at depth intervals not exceeding  20mm.  

Rate of penetration.  The rate of penetration  whether or not readings are being taken shall  normally be   $20\pm5\mathsf{m m}/\mathsf{s}$  .  (b)  Data for site record and the intervals of  measurements.  Measure and record the  following:  (i)  the cone resistance (q c ) (in MPa) (see  Clause 24.96); and    (ii)  the local unit side friction resistance (f s ) (in  MPa) (see Clause 24.96)    (iii) the pore water pressure measured (u)  acting on the piezometric sensor (in kPa)  plotted against depth relative to Principal  Datum (PD).    (iv) The inclinometer value (in degrees or  radians).  Plots of these parameters should superimposed  against a depth relative to Principal Datum (PD)  

(9) Sounds from, or unusual vibrations of, the push rods,  (representing indications of the presence of coarse  material or obstructions) shall be noted and the depths  corresponding to when they occurred.  

(10) Record any unusual event during the test including the  depths at which the push rods may have been  extruded over a limited height in order to break the  lateral resistance, and then been pushed into soil.  

(a) Continuous penetration shall stop at depths  where pore water pressure dissipation tests are  required by the Engineer.  The pore water  pressure and cone resistance shall be recorded  at the termination of the cone stroke and  monitored at intervals initially not greater than 10  seconds.  The dissipation test shall not be  terminated until at least   $50\%$   of the excess pore  water pressure generated at the end of the cone  stroke has dissipated.  The cone resistance  measured at the end of the continuous  penetration shall be kept constant throughout the  duration of the test.    (b) Post-test checks and records.  Check and  record the following at the end of each test.    (c)  Immediately upon completion of each test, when  the resistance measuring equipment is unloaded,  record the reading for both the cone and friction  sleeve if fitted and used.    (d) Inspect the cone, sleeve, seals and piezometers  where fitted, for damage and wear since the  commencement of the test.    (e) Inspect the push rods for alignment and damage.  

(11) Where wear of the sleeve or cone has taken place  during the test such that either has reached a state  where during the test it should have been replaced,  the test shall remain valid but shall include in the  reports a statement describing the condition of the  sleeve and cone at the end of the test.  

(a) Record, where possible, the depth to the water  level in the hole after withdrawal of the  penetrometer tip, or the depth at which the hole  collapsed. 

  

 (b) Record whether the test hole has been backfield,  and if so by which method. 

  

 (c)  Record the identification number of the  penetrometer tip used for the test. 

  

 (d) Record the dates and reference numbers of the  calibration certificates for the measuring devices. 

  

 (e) Record the name of the operator in charge of the  crew which performed the test.

(1) Where topsoil and turf is present at a trial pit position  the Contractor shall initially remove all the existing  topsoil and turf over the areas of the excavation and  the main spoil tip.  The topsoil and turf shall be  stockpiled separately from other excavated material.  

(2) On completion of field work the contractor shall  replaced topsoil and turf over the areas of the  excavation and the main spoil tip and remove all  surplus materials from the site.  

# Backfilling of  Trial Pits  

(1) Trial pits shall be backfilled as soon as instructed by  the Engineer.  The backfilling material shall not  contain boulders or rock fragments greater than 75mm  and shall be compacted in layers not exceeding  150mm in thickness to its former density or a higher  density until original ground level is restored.  The  ground surface shall be restored to its condition prior  to the investigation i.e. pitching, paving, chunam,  topsoil and turf shall be replaced.  Any subsequent  depression of the surface shall be filled in and  compacted by the Contractor at his own cost.  All  surplus materials shall be removed from the site.   Where trial pits, or other excavations, have been  opened in roadways or pavements under Highways  Department jurisdiction reinstatement shall comply  with Highways Department requirements.  

(2) The sides of excavations shall be adequately  supported at all times to ensure the safeguarding of  life and property.  As backfilling proceeds, timber,  sheeting and other excavation supports can be  progressively removed at the discretion of the  Contractor, but the removal of such supports will not  relieve the Contractor of his responsibilities for the  safety and stability of the work.  

(3) On completion of backfilling and prior to any  reinstatement of the ground surface, a further set of  three number GCO Probe tests shall be carried out in  a triangular pattern not more that 0.80m apart around  the centre of each trial pit.  They shall terminate at the  same depth as the initial set of probes carried out prior  to excavation.  All GCO Probe tests shall be carried  out in accordance with Clause 24.72 (including all  reporting required), although surveying of their  locations shall not be necessary.  The compaction of  the backfilled material shall be such that the average  GCO Probe test value of the second set of probes  shall be at least   $80\%$   of the value of the first set of  probes carried out at each trial pit, or a value of at  least 16, whichever is the smaller.  Notwithstanding  this requirement, any subsequent depression of the  ground surface occurring due to settlement shall be  filled in and compacted by the Contractor at his own  cost.

# GOODMAN JACK TEST  

# 1.  Introduction  

The Goodman Jack Test gives an in-situ measurement of the modulus of deformation of  the rock.  

The system comprises mainly:-  

1.1  An expanding jack which consists of two curved bearing plates. 

  

 1.2  A hydraulic pump which produces a unidirectional pressure to the borehole walls  through the bearing plates. 

  

 1.3  2 Self-contained LVDTs to measure the displacements which are displayed on a  portable indicator.  

By rotating the jack through   $90^{0}\mathsf{i n}$   the borehole and carrying out the tests again at the  same elevation the degree of modulus anisotropy may be assessed.  

The analysis of the Goodman Jack and the application of proposed correction factors are  described by Heuze and Amadei (1984), and Heuze (1984).  

# 2.  Procedure  

The Goodman Jack was designed to be used in NX drillholes. It is calibrated before use  and recalibrated whenever necessary.  

The test is carried out using the following procedure:  

2.1  Prepare the test section by using core barrel with reaming shell so as to minimize  the hole/jack radius mismatch. 

  

 2.2  The test hole to determine the diameter deviation from 76.2mm or use the jack  for such determination if the jack is properly calibrated before hand. 

  

 2.3  Lower the jack into the drillhole by attaching it to BX casing. The casing provides  maximum protection to the jack, hoses and cable. Mark the orientation of the  loading plates on the casing. 

  

 2.4  Use the hand pump, and apply the pressure until the pressure gauge indicates a  value equal to 70 bar. Record the displacements as indicated on the read-out  unit.  

2.5  Continue to increase the pressure in increments of 70 bar to the maximum of  630 bar, and record the displacements at the end of each increment of pressure.    2.6  Unload in decrements of 70 bar and record the displacements at the end of each  decrement.    2.7  Repeat steps 2.5 and 2.6 to give a second cycle.    2.8  It may be necessary to apply a small amount of pressure with the handle in order  to hold the pressure constant. This small leakage may occur within the pump. A  constant pressure should be maintained while taking the readings.    2.9  In order to evaluate creep in the material, hold the pressure constant for a  suitable length of time, approximately five minutes, and record LVDT readings  every minute or other suitable period.    2.10  It is important to note the difference between the readings for each LVDT. Any  difference means that the movable jack plate is titling due to discontinuity in the  borehole wall or a non-uniformity in the strength of the material. This could mean  that the jack is located at a transition zone. When the difference between  readings reaches approximately 0.51mm, excessive wear on the guide pins and  LVDT adapter may occur. When tilting greater than this takes place, it is  recommended that the test be discontinued and the jack moved up or down to  another location where the material may be more homogeneous and uniform.    2.11  Increase pressure and make readings of displacement versus pressure. A  suggested data form is included in this appendix. Sufficient increments should be  taken to insure an accurate plot of load versus displacement beyond the  minimum hydraulic pressure Qh min .    2.12  When sufficient readings are obtained, reverse the procedure, reducing pressure  by carefully cracking the valve on the pump. This allows oil to be bled back into  the pump reservoir under control. Stop and make readings of displacement and  pressure at sufficient increments to observe the rebound characteristics of the  material. The jack shall be close before moving it to another test point.    3. Special Procedure for Testing in Soft Rock   3.1  For testing in soft rock, Goodman Jack model no. 52102 is preferably used. It  may be necessary to use the pressure gauge having a lower range which can be  adapted to connect to the T-coupling at the pump. It may also be necessary to  modify the test procedure to measure the consolidation properties of the material.  To do this, apply a suitable increment of pressure, say 0.7 MPa, when using a 7  MPa gauge.  

3.2  Hold the pressure constant with the pump handle, recording the meter indication  of displacement for each LVDT every minute. Continue until the displacement  becomes constant to within some arbitrary value, say   $5\%$  , of the initial  displacement. Apply the next increment of pressure and repeat the readings.  

3.3  The plot of final deflection for each increment plotted versus pressure becomes  the consolidation curve. Some variations may be necessary in the foregoing as  determined for the material being tested. 

  

 3.4  In the drilling of the boreholes in soft rock, it must be remembered that the  Goodman Jack is designed to operate in NX holes; that is, 76.2mm diameter,  nominal. The jack pressure plate extension is limited to 82.6mm diameter and  this means that the hole must be drilled with reasonable precision in order for  any data to be obtained. This requirement is more important in soft rock because  the material consolidates more under the jack pressure plates, producing more  displacement. This means that the allowance for oversize boreholes in less than  for hard rock holes. The situation in soft rock holes is more of problem because  the hole tends to be worn oversize by whipping action of the rods and washing  action of the drilling water carrying the cuttings. For this reason, planning the  drilling procedure should be done with care and with the expectation of  reasonable precision in the diameter of the completed boreholes. 

  

 3.5  Some types of soft rock may tend to disintegrate or soften whenever exposed to  the water used in drilling. In this case, and when the borehole is oversize, it will  be necessary to run the Goodman Jack tests immediately after coring every   $3.0\mathsf{m}$   of borehole. The system is readily adaptable to this method of operation.  Depending on the type of drill rig being used, as much as 12 to   $15\,\mathsf{m}$   of BX  casing attached to the Goodman Jack may be stood vertically, tied to the mast,  while drilling the next 3.0m. Other sections are readily added and removed,  threading them over the hoses. Extra hose facilitates the usage and handing of  BX casing under these circumstances. 

  

 3.6  In situations where the Goodman Jack tests must be made immediately following  the coring operation, then the planning of the test programme must include  allowance for the additional time needed for in and cut of the borehole with the  jack and the protective BX casing. 

  

 3.7  Care must be used at all times to protect the hose when it is bent over the sharp  edge of the casing.  

# 4. Interpretation of Data  

The deformation modulus of rock is related to the slope of the applied pressure Qh  versus diametrical deformation D plot.  

The determination of the deformation modulus E true  shall follow the analysis procedure  recommended by F.E. Heuze and B. Amadei, in their paper "The NX-borehole Jack-a  Lession in trial-and-Errors", International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Science,  January 1984.  

Details of the procedure are as flows  

4.1  Determine the modulus of cores E core . This may be used as upper bound to E true .  Alternatively, for a closer estimate of E true  multiply E core  by 0.4. This is based on  the extensive review of E core /E field  performed and reported earlier by Heuze. If  E true  is estimated at more than 6.9MPa the plate bending correction must be  made.  

4.2  Based on the hole diameter deviation and the estimated E true , use the results of  Tables 1 or 2 in this appendix to determine the minimum hydraulic pressure  Qh min  required for full contact. This Qh min  is quite insensitive to J, which can be  assumed at 0.25 without appreciable error on the procedure. The test then must  be pursued beyond Qh min  and the test data retained for analysis are only those  above Qh min . As an alternative, it can be argued that when the  pressure-deformation record becomes linear, after typically starting as concave  upward, full contact has been reached. Preferably, this should only be used as a  check on Qh min .  

4.3  Use the equation below to calculate E calc .  

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{\mathsf{E_{c a l c}}}&{=}&{0.86\times0.93\times\mathsf{D}\times\mathsf{Q h}/\ \mathsf{D}\times\mathsf{T^{\star}}}\end{array}
$$  

Where:  

E calc    $=$  calculated modulus  D   $=$  diameter of test hole  Qh   $=$  change of applied pressure  D   $=$  change of hole diameter  T \*   obtained from Amadei (1984)   $=$      in Table 4 with the appropriate      If J is not known, use   $\begin{array}{r l r}{\mathsf{T}^{\star}}&{{}=}&{1.43\%}\end{array}$        corresponding to   ${\mathsf{J}}=0.25$  .  

4.4  Now use either Figure 1 or 2 in this appendix (selection based on J) to find E true from E calc .  

# 5. Calibration of Displacement  

It is recommended that this calibration be carried out in a protected shop environment.  

5.1  Micrometer calipers or vernier calipers capable of measuring from 69.9 to  82.6mm to 0.01mm provide the simplest method of measuring the diametrical  distance to the outside of the jack bearing plates. The radius of the pressure  plates is 38.10mm and one-half the actual jack diameter only when this distance  is 76.20mm. Care must be used to insure that the micrometer is placed at the  same point on each end of the pressure plate.  

5.2  Connect the system as described in the Operating Instructions section and  operate the pump to expand the jack until the jack diameter is approximately  76.20mm. A useful tool is a thick-wall steel ring bored out to 76.20mm inside  diameter. If zero is to be 78.70mm, expand jack to this diameter, as above.  

5.3  Record the reading for each LVDT (near and far). With the micrometer, measure  the diameter accurately at each end of the pressure plates. Compare this  measurement with the reading of deviation and note the difference and direction.  

  

 5.4  Adjust the zero position of the LVDT magnetic core by following the preceding  section. Adjust the position of the core so that each LVDT reading is the  deviation between measured diameter and desired "zero"; i.e. 76.20mm or  78.70mm.  

  

 5.5  Set pump valve to Cylinder No. 2 position and retract jack past the "zero" point.  Reverse pump valve to Cylinder No. 1 position. Take two or three points each  side of "zero" recording near and far deviation reading and micrometer  measurements of diameter at each end of the pressure plate. Take the average  difference (from zero) obtained by these points and readjust the zero position of  the LVDT magnetic core accordingly, as necessary.  

  

 5.6  After the zero reading has been adjusted, the next step is to adjust the scale  factor. Expand the jack pressure plate to approximately 2.54mm beyond the zero  diameter. If jack "zero" is 76.20mm, expand the plate to 78.70mm diameter.  Measure the actual diameter with the micrometer at each end of the plate. There  may be a slight difference (0.13mm) because of frictional difference at each end.  

  

 5.7  Remove the panel from the indicator box after removing the hold down screws.  On the back side, locate the variable resistance potentiometer on the printed  circuit card. These are marked "near" and "Far". Using a screwdriver, adjust the  pot so that the deviation reading for near and far LVDT is equal to the actual  diameter measured with the micrometer. In other works, if when reading is  approximately  $+2.54\mathsf{m m}$  . Set pump valve in neutral position.  

  

 5.8  Both LVDTs usually will not read the same because of unequal friction in the jack.  An alternative method would be to use a steel ring bored out to 78.7mm inside  diameter.  

  

 5.9  With the special T-handle wrench provided, remove the two sealing caps from  the jack body. This exposes the zero adjusting screws. Loosen the check nut  with the 5/6-inch box wrench. Turn the screw moving the LVDT core until the  indicator reading changes 2.54 scale units. For example, if initial reading is 2.44,  move core until the new reading is -0.10. Tighten check nut. Replace sealing cap.  Repeat for both LVDTs.  

  

 5.10  This procedure will normally be sufficient since it is the changes of diameter that  are of concern in field testing. If a more exact correlation between actual jack  diameter is required, a full calibration will be necessary. See next section.  

5.11  Set the pump valve to Cylinder No. 2 position. Apply retracting pressure to the  jack by operating the pump handle. As the jack closes, observe the meter  indication. Verify readings when jack is closed. Set pump valve to neutral  position.

APPENDIX 24.5  SONIC TESTING  

# Appendix 24.5  

# SONIC TESTING OF ROCK CORE  

These tests are intended to measure the seismic wave velocity of compressional and  transverse waves of rock samples. The method will follow the ISRM (International Society of  Rock Mechanics) Method 2 unless otherwise specified.  

The rock core will be selected by the Engineer for these tests and returned to him  undamaged for secondary testing of the elastic moduli. Rock cores for testing will be stored  in moisture proof bags to preserve their natural moisture content. A PUNDIT or similar  testing machine will be used in the frequency range 100 to 1000 KHz, with lower frequency  being used on the granitic samples and higher frequency for samples of volcanic rock.  Unless otherwise directed by the Engineer, the rock core specimens shall be soaked in  water 24 hours prior to testing.  

The method employed will use two transducers placed on the long side of the rock core.  Transducer separation will be varied and travel times of P and S waves measured. These  results will be plotted as a graph of travel time against distance from which the velocity of P  and S waves can be calculated.  

Transducer separation should be 20 to   $140\;\mathsf{m m}$   and the transducers coupled to the sample  with a jelly or grease.  

The report should include the following information:  

(1)  Rock type, exact origin, (e.g. geographical location, geological formation, quarry,  depth of drillholes, special geological or structural feature where taken from). 

 (2)  Specimen dimensions and specimen geometry. 

 (3)  How rock material was obtained (e.g. blasting in a quarry, drilling on fresh or  weathered surface).

# CHERCHAR ABRASIVENESS TEST  

# Appendix 24.6  

# CHERCHAR ABRASIVENESS TEST  

# Apparatus  

A sharp steel conical point of cone angle   $90^{\mathrm{0}}$   shall be applied to the surface of the rock  specimen under a load of 7 kgf. The rock specimen, beneath the steel tool, shall be held  securely in a vice which can be moved in a controlled manner with a screw thread device, or  similar. Displacement distance of the vice, and hence the mounted rock sample, shall be  measured with a scale or gauge. A total load of   $70~\mathsf{N}$   shall be applied, and held constant, to  the surface of the rock specimen through the steel tool.  

The steel tool shall be made from   $10\:\mathsf{m m}$   diameter steel rod with a   $90^{\mathrm{0}}$   conical point formed  at one end.  The steel point shall be made from   $200~\mathsf{K g f}/\mathsf{m m}^{2}$   steel or alternatively EN24  steel which has been heat treated to Rockwell Hardness C40.  

# Test Method  

A thin coating of light machine oil shall be applied to the shaft of the steel tool before  mounting into a holder which maintains the tool firmly and securely.  The weight required to  achieve a total load of 70N on the specimen shall be applied before displacing the rock  specimen.  

The vice holding the rock specimen shall then be slowly displaced a distance of   $10~\mathsf{m m}$  , as  determined by the mounted scale or gauge.  The test should be completed in about 1 min.  After cleaning any rock debris from the conical tip the wear flat shall be measured using a  reading microscope with a magnification no less than X24. The reading microscope shall be  fitted with a micrometer graduated to 0.01 mm and readable to 0.001 mm. Because the test  process results in asymmetrical wear, the wear diameter on the steel point shall be  measured at 4 positions,  $90^{0}$   offset from each other. The mean value of the 4 readings shall  be taken as the wear diameter for the steel tool. The wear flat diameter in mm, multiplied by  10, shall be given as the abrasiveness of the rock (CAI).  

5 tests, known as a test series, shall be made by the same operator on the surface of the  test specimen.  

# Comments on testing  

During a normal CHERCHAR test two things occur: the steel tool cuts a groove in the rock,  and the rock produces abrasion of the tip of the tool. However where rocks are so soft that  no detectable wear can be seen on the tip of the tool at the end of the test, a zero abrasion  value shall be recorded. Test results shall also report the reason for the zero abrasion value  result.  

Where rocks are so hard that the tool is unable to cut a groove, and although the steel point  is blunted, it has not interacted properly with the rock to form a genuine abrasion wear flat.  With hard rocks it is therefore necessary to examine the specimen after the test carefully to  ensure that the tool has bitten into the rock, rather than just skated over the surface (a x 10  hand lens is useful for making this examination). If this happens, the rock shall be reported  as being too hard to test.  

If the test specimen is anisotropic, banded or markedly bedded, the test series shall be  conducted both parallel and perpendicular to schistosity to determine anisotropic effects.  

# Reporting  

The report should include the following information:  

(1)  Rock type, lithologic description including grain size and strength, exact origin, (e.g.  geographical location, geological formation, quarry, depth of drillholes, special  geological or structural feature where taken from). 

  

 (2)  Specimen dimensions, diameter and height. 

  

 (3)  Orientation of the axis of loading with respect to specimen anisotropy, e.g. bedding  planes, foliation, etc. 

  

 (4)  How rock material obtained, dates and method of sample extraction (e.g. blasting in  quarry, drilling on fresh or weathered surface), storage history and environment. 

  

 (5)  Number of specimens tested. 

  

 (6)  Date of testing, type of testing machine, nature of steel tool and description. 

  

 (7)  Water content and degree of saturation of rock sample at time of test.

# APPENDIX 24.7  

HYDROFACTURE TEST DETAILS  

# Appendix 24.7  

# DRILLHOLE HYDROFRACTURING TESTS  

# General  

Borehole hydrofracture stress measurements are required to establish in-situ stress  conditions, for tunnel or cavern structures.  

The drillholes will be drilled to full depth and then subsequently tested using the  hydrofracture test method over an interval corresponding to the proposed crown   $(\pm~10~\mathsf{m})$   of  the proposed underground opening. The maximum test depth would be some   $150~\mathsf{m}$   below  ground surface.  

# Test Principles  

The principle of the hydrofracture test can be summarised as follows:  

–  Execution of core assessment to determine suitable zones for testing based on :  –  lack of fractures over packer sealing zones;    –  lack of fractures over test section or occurrence of single, well-defined fracture. 

 –  Isolation of test interval using straddle packer system. Packers inflated to a pressure  based on test injection pressure. 

 –  Fracturing of test interval using a controlled flow/pressure source. 

 –  Cycling of injection pressures/flows to obtain representative estimates of the 'shut-in'  pressure. 

 –  Execution of impression packer tests over the test interval to obtain fracture traces and  orientations. 

 –  Expert evaluation of flow-pressure responses to determine minimum principle stress  field and orientation. May also be possible to obtain qualitative or semi-quantitative data  on other principle stress magnitudes/orientations.  

# Test Equipments  

The hydrofracture test equipment shall be supplied by a manufacturer with competence and  prior experience in the manufacture of such equipment.  

–  Straddle packers to isolate the test interval. Minimum packer sealing length   $1.0~\mathsf{m}$  . Test  

interval length 0.5 - 1.0m.  

–  Drill rods to place the packer assembly at the required depth and for pressurisation of  the test interval. 

 –  Prime mover, injection pump, and flow control manifold with pressure and flowmeter  transducers. 

 –  Downhole pressure transducer for measurement of test interval pressures. 

 –  Compressed nitrogen supply, pneumatic hose, pressure gauge and transducer for  packer inflation. 

 –  Four channel paper chart recorder displaying mainifold pressure, test interval pressure,  packer pressure, and flowrate. 

 –  Impression packer assembly for obtaining fracture traces at the test interval.  

The pressurisation and monitoring equipment must be capable of initiating fracture in the  granite (which has a tensile strength of the order of 15 MPa and subsequently recording  accurately, potentially low shut-in pressures in the range   $500~\mathsf{k P a}$   (5 bar) - 1500 kPa (15  bar).  

Similar accurate flow measurements in the ranges 0.05 to 5 litres/min and 1.0 to 50  litres/min will be required.  

# Test Requirements  

At least five successful tests per drillhole are required for evaluation of the stress field. The  adequacy of the tests shall be based on the field results obtained, including the fracture  impressions, and shall be subject to approval by the Engineer.  

The personnel to carry out the test must be experienced and have prior approval from the  Engineer.  

A full report of the conduct of each test is required together with all salient test records.

# GEOPHYSICS BOREHOLE LOGGING  

# GEOPHYSICAL BOREHOLE LOGGING  

Borehole logging may be required in some or all of the land boreholes.  

The drillholes will be drilled to full depth and then the bedrock logged to determine the  contact between surficial soil and the inplace weathered (Grade V) bedrock and the contact  between weathered and fresh (Grade II) bedrock.

# MARINE GEOPHYSICS  

# Introduction  

A number of marine geophysical techniques are proposed to investigate superficial  sediments, weathering and zones of weakness within the rockmass. The success of any  one method will be dependent upon site conditions and therefore each proposed method  will require performance evaluation on site.  

It is proposed to initially undertake an analogue seismic reflection survey, followed by an  ultra-high resolution digital seismic reflection survey in areas of poor analogue data.

This method of test is intended to measure the uniaxial compressive strength of a rock  sample in the form of specimens of regular geometry. The test is mainly intended for  strength classification and characterization of intact rock.  

# 2. Apparatus  

(1) A suitable machine shall be used for applying and measuring axial load to the  specimen. It shall be of sufficient capacity and capable of applying load at a rate  conforming to the requirements set in Section 3. It shall be verified at suitable time  intervals and shall comply with accepted national requirements such as prescribed  in either ASTM Methods E4-64, verification of Testing Machines (1969 ASTM  Book of Standard Parts 30 and 31) or British Standard 1610:1964, Grad A or  Deutsche Normen DIN 51 220 and DIN 51 223, Class 1 and DIN 51 300.  

(2) A spherical seat, If any, of the testing machine, if not complying with specification  2(d) below, shall be removed or placed in a locked position, the two loading faces  of the machine being parallel to each other.  

(3) Discs having a Rockwell harness of not less than HRC 58 shall be placed at the  specimen ends. The diameter of the discs shall be the same as the diameter of the  specimen. The thickness of the discs shall be at least 15mm. Surfaces of the discs  should be ground and their flatness should be 0.005mm.  

(4) One of the two discs shall incorporate a spherical seat. The spherical seat should  be placed on the upper end of the specimen. It should be lightly lubricated with  mineral oil so that it locks after the deadweight of the cross-head has been picked  up. The specimen, the discs and spherical seat shall be accurately centred with  respect to one another and to the loading machine. The curvature centre of the  seat surface should coincide with the centre of the specimen top face.  

# 3. Procedure  

(1) Test specimens shall be straight circular cylinders having a length to diameter ratio  of 2.0 and a diameter preferably of not less than NX core size, approximately  54mm. The diameter of the specimen should be related to the size of the largest  grain in rock by the ratio of at least 10:1.  

(2) The ends of the specimen shall be cut parallel to each other and at right angles to  the longitudinal axis.  

(3) The ends of the specimen shall be flat to 0.02mm.

# Preparatory Work  for Blasting  

25.36  All blasting work for bulk excavation of tunnels and shafts  shall be carried out using perimeter drilling and blasting  techniques to control the geometry of and to minimise any  damage to the final excavation profile and minimise  geological overbreak.   

 25.37  All charges shall be accurately made up and inserted into  the holes at the correct spacing, and all holes shall be  correctly stemmed and connected in the correct sequence  with detonators being correctly delayed.   

 25.38  Controlled Blasting shall incorporate, but may not be limited  to, pre-splitting or smooth blasting techniques, decoupled  charges and shall make use of explosives specifically  manufactured for these purposes.   

 25.39  (1) The Contractor shall carry out Controlled Blasting so  as to achieve a final blast surface that exhibits a  regular fracture plane between barrels without  underbreak or overbreak greater than 200mm and with  half barrels visible over a minimum of  $80\%$   of the  excavation surface.    (2) Borehole deviation over the final blast surface shall not  exceed  $0.5\%$   of the total borehole length.    (3) If at any time the methods of drilling and blasting do  not produce a uniform profile within the tolerances  specified, no further blasting works are permitted until  the Contractor establishes a technique that results in  an excavation profile to the specified tolerances.  

25.40  Before assessments of blasting safety precautions are  made, all vegetation, overburden and soft or loose material  which might conceal jointing or rock quality shall be  removed to expose the rock to be blasted.  

Blasting  Restrictions for  Surface  Earthworks  

Controlled   Blasting of  Earthworks   Final Surface  

# 25.41  

(1) Unless otherwise permitted by the COM, plasmer  blasting shall not be used. 

  

 (2) Unless otherwise permitted by the Commissioner of  Mines, sufficient protective measures shall be available  on site, prior to the issue of a Blasting Permit and  subject to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of  Mines, to prevent the projection of flying fragments of  materials (flyrock) resulting from blasting. 

  

 (3) Unless otherwise permitted by the COM delay blasting  shall be used for all blasting except as stated in  Clause 25.42(6). 

  

 (4) Unless otherwise permitted by the COM screens and  other protective covers as specified in the approved  Method Statement shall be erected to prevent the  projection of flying fragments of material resulting from  blasting.   

  

 (5) The final surface tolerance of surface earthworks  excavated by blasting shall be in accordance with  Clause 6.38. 

  

 (1) Earthworks final surfaces which are to be formed by  blasting and which slope at a gradient exceeding 2  vertical to 1 horizontal and exceed 3m in height shall  be formed by presplitting. Other methods of controlled  blasting shall not be used unless permitted by the  Engineer. 

  

 (2) Presplitting and other methods of controlled blasting  shall be carried out in such a manner that the rock  mass is cleanly split on the required plane to within the  specified tolerance and such that the remaining rock  mass is not shattered or loosened. 

  

 (3) Faces formed by presplitting or other methods of  controlled blasting shall not exceed 10m in height in  any one blasting operation unless permitted by the  Engineer. 

  

 (4) Presplitting or other controlled blasting techniques  shall consist of a single row of holes drilled at the  appropriate inclination along the line of the earthworks  final surface.  

(5) If an earthworks final surface is to be formed by  presplitting or other methods of controlled blasting:  

(a) other blast holes shall be located at a sufficient  distance from the earthworks final surface to  avoid damaging the surface;  (b) the row of blast holes nearest to that surface shall  be parallel to the row of pre-splitting holes.  

(6) Holes for presplitting or other methods of controlled  blasting shall be loaded with explosives of a size not  exceeding half the diameter of the hole.  The  explosives shall be detonated simultaneously or with  the minimum amount of delay necessary to reduce  ground vibrations.  

(7) The depth of burden, bench height, charge-weights,  hole spacing and size shall be designed to split the  rock between charge holes in advance of the bulk  excavation and leave a clean smooth surface without  damage to the rock remaining in situ.  The finished  surface is to have irregularities not more than ±150mm  from the designed surface.  

(8) Holes for presplitting or other methods of controlled  blasting, formed by means other than hand held  drilling, shall be at least 50mm in diameter and the  ratio of the distance between the centre of the holes  and the diameter of the hole shall not exceed 10 or the  distance determined following appropriate blasting  trials, whichever is the smallest.  The holes shall be  within a distance of 0.015 times the length of the holes  from their designated position.  

(9) Holes for presplitting or other methods of controlled  blasting, formed by hand held drilling methods, shall  comply with the hole diameter and hole spacing as  established following appropriate blasting trials.  

(10) Holes for presplitting or other methods of controlled  blasting shall not be drilled into the subgrade below  berm levels. Rock which remains in position on berms  after blasting shall be removed by methods other than  blasting.  

(11) Individual holes drilled for presplitting or other methods  of controlled blasting shall be straight over the full  drilled length with a deviation not greater than  $0.5\%$   of  the length of the hole.  

(12) Holes drilled for presplitting or other methods of  controlled blasting to form the blasted earthworks final  surfaces shall be aligned; in section all to the same  gradient as that required for this final face within the  tolerance defined in Clause 6.38, and; in plan to a  tolerance not greater than   $5\%$   of the distance between  adjacent presplitting or controlled blasting boreholes.  

(13) If at any time, any method of drilling and blasting does  not produce a uniform final surface profile without  overbreak, all within the tolerances specified, the  Contractor shall undertake further trials until a  technique is established that results in an excavation  profile to the specified tolerances.
