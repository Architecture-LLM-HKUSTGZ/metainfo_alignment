# DESIGN SAFETY  

General  

# G6.1.1  

Owing to the paramount importance of the safety of passengers  and staff, utmost attention must be paid in design matters that  can have an effect on safety.  This includes not only the  performance of the E&M systems, but also matters such as  crowd  control  in  stations,  maintenance  of  tolerable  environmental conditions and standby operation under  emergency conditions.  

G6.1.2  The  Contractor , to the extent that it is responsible for design or  for the selection of particular items of Plant and Materials, takes  cognisance of the safety requirements and ensures that the  design and performance of the Plant and Materials selected are  of the highest standards and are compatible with the safety  standards of the railway system.      G6.1.3  The designs of the  Contractor  must prevent the occurrence of  unsafe conditions arising.  

# G6.1.4  

For guidance, the principal aspects of the philosophy of design  are given below:  

(a)  Train services are to be provided without reducing any  safety standards under any conditions, except for  complete and simultaneous failure of power supply at all  infeed points.   

 (b)  Local override control in the event of a failure is to be  provided.   

 (c)  Items of Plant and Materials and cables in stations,  tunnels, above grade and at grade sections are to be  suitably located so as to minimise possible damage in the  event of accidents.   

 (d)  Failure of the power supply at one infeed point, or any  single failure within the railway system, is not to  substantially affect the overall operation of the railway.   Where appropriate, automatic changeover from one  power source to another is to be provided.   

 (e)  Emergency lighting, fire services and security must be  maintained under all conditions of power failure.   

 (f)  Provision is to be made for continued operation in the  tunnel sections under typhoon conditions.   

 (g)  The system is to be designed to minimise tunnel and  station flooding during conditions of heavy prolonged  

# rainfall.

Fire Resistance  G6.5.1  Periods  

Only materials which do not support combustion and do not emit  corrosive, noxious or toxic fumes when heated are to be used.   Where it is not possible to meet these requirements, materials  are selected which provide the minimum practicable hazard.  Care is taken in the design and selection of Plant and Materials  to minimise the spread of fire in the event that it does occur.  

Structures are designed so that the various different areas have  the minimum FRP as set out below:

$  

# G6.5.2  

The relevant periods of fire resistance are detailed above.  The  Contractor  ensures that in no circumstances does any Plant and  Materials or E&M systems that penetrate these structures  reduce or cause to reduce the FRP of any area.  In particular,  adequate fire stopping is to be reinstated around all cable, pipe  and duct in penetrations so that heat and smoke migration are  inhibited for the relevant period.  Ventilation and air transfer  ducts which penetrate fire compartments are to be either fitted  with an appropriate fire damper of equivalent fire resistance or  the ductwork is to be fabricated of material such that the fire  resistance of the duct construction is equal to that of the highest  rated compartment penetrated.

The  table as a minimum contains issues, agreed actions and action  by date.  The  Contractor  and the Designated or Interfacing  Contractors review the table in every interface meeting to agree  on new issues to be added and items already resolved.  The  Contractor  sends a copy of the table to the  Project Manager following each meeting.  

Any disagreement arising between the  Contractor  and the  Designated and Interfacing Contractors is brought immediately  to the attention of the  Project Manager .  The  Project Manager’s decision is binding on both parties and forms the basis of the  accepted of interface design.  

A separate interface specification is submitted by the  Contractor for each interfacing contract detailing the interface aspects.  

Acceptance of the interface design is through acceptance of  interface specification submission in accordance with the  design approval process.  The  Project Manager  will review all  interface specifications submitted to ensure that they are  compatible.  Acceptance will be given by the  Project Manager when he is satisfied that the interface specifications contain  compatible designs and are in compliance with the interface  requirements specified in this General Specification and the  Scope.

The  Contractor’s  modelling strategy incorporates predicted  workloads for various contract stages and respective resourcing  strategy and management.  

The  Contractor  develops a Standard Approach of Modelling,  which considers the project work break down structure and cost  break down structure, for the development of other Information  Model uses.  

The  Contractor  demonstrates to the  Project Manager’s acceptance through the BEP as to how its BIM models and  related drawings are divided based on linked files (and other  Model Files if applicable), Worksets, Disciplines / Systems,  Volumes / Zones and areas. These represent the extents in  which its Discipline Teams can coordinate their designs in  structures, rooms, circulation spaces or service routes.  Assurances and evidence are provided to ensure coordination  between  different  disciplines  and  different  volumes.  Management procedures of any interfaces between the  subdivided models / Data are clearly outlined. The  Contractor develops a model federation strategy that graphically portrays  the model / information beakdown, model contents, native file  formats, interdependencies (i.e. linked model data) and  purposes for inclusion in the BEP.  

The  Contractor  keeps file sizes of each sub-divided BIM models  to a minimum by purging of unused views, objects and settings  before publishing or submission. The maximum file size for  each subdivided BIM model does not exceed 500MB unless  otherwise accepted by the  Project Manager .  

Design, coordination and technical reviews are required at all  stages of the contract. The  Contractor  shows in the Deliverable  Production Schedule (DPS) what Information is shared with the  Client and the  Project Manager , and when and at what  frequency to ensure that key decisions can be made based on  accurate, federated and relevant production Information.  

The  Contractor  makes use of the BIM and construction  drawings to facilitate the indication of construction method,  coordination of works between disciplines, checking of clashes  including proposed solutions for the   Project Manager’s acceptance. Any conflicts, clashes and coordination issues  identified are documented in the format of clash reports as part  of the required progress report. The  Contractor  uses the latest  Project  Deliverables (incl.  Drawings)

In order to extract the quantities from the model in accordance  with the above standards, the model is built according to the  specific methodology called Standard Approach of Modelling  (SAM).  

The  Contractor’s  quantity surveyor coordinates with the  Contractor’s  BIM Manager for the production of SAM.  The  Contractor  ensures that the quantities extracted from the  Discipline Model comply with the requirements in the above  Documents, otherwise the  Contractor  proposes measures for  obtaining the   Project Manager’s  acceptance. The  Contractor demonstrates to the   Project Manager’s  Project Information  Manager the workability of the SAM prior to commencing the  work.  

The  Contractor  defines in the BEP how the  Contractor  carries  out internal issue management, coordination and Clash  Analysis. The  Contractor  outlines in the process the quality  checking and model integrity procedures, including the  confirmation that the correct element naming standards of  reference views and building objects / systems and clash  tolerances (hard and Soft Clashes) are set up before the  analysis is carried out.  

The  Contractor  clearly demonstrates the workflow through  which the identified clashes are managed, including the   Project  Manager’s  digital review process, coordination workshops,  clash registers, standard reference views in the coordination  files and assigning responsibilities together with close out  deadlines.
