## 6. Works Methodology

### 6.1 Preparation Works

Trees to be felled were marked with label. Contractor shall only fell those trees shown as Appendix A. Before the tree felling, the trees will be cordoned off by temporary fence to fence off the operation area and other people from their falling zone. The cordoned off area should be as far as practicable, based on on-site situation. The worker holds relevant certificates (Chainsaw Safety Pruning, Tree Climbing, etc). All certificates and documents of equipment required shall be checked on site. Pre-work Briefing or training shall be provided to workers by frontline supervisors daily. Non-transparent plastic panels shall be provided at adequate distance around the tree to be felled. "Lookout man" shall be provided to standby outside the tree felling works area during the whole operation to keep anyone from not entering the workplace. Outmost care shall be taken into consideration during the felling works to avoid adjacent existing properties and plants to be retained/ transplanted from any damages. All worker for tree felling works shall wear their personal protective equipment, such as safety belt and helmet, at all times of the works. Protection from damage of existing underground utilities shall be completed commencement of the tree felling works. An escape route shall be established. A path of escape from the work area shall be determined for the chain saw operator to use after the felling cuts are made and the tree begins to fall. An ideal escape route should be at a 45-degree angle from the tree's direction of fall.

The escape route shall be cleared of any brush or ground debris, including any equipment. The minimum retreat distance shall be 6 meters.

A least 2 ground operators shall manage pedestrian safety at 2 ends of the works area during the whole operation.

TTA will be provide if necessary.

### 6.2 Tree Felling

#### 6.2.1 Sequence of Tree Felling Works by Climbing (Scenario 1)

Tree Felling will comply with the standard of American National. Standard for Arboricultural Operations (ANSI Z133) - Safety Requirements.

Before starting any tree felling work, the supervisor will coordinate with site representative to ensure that no trees are felled wrongly. All trees to be felled shall be confirmed ad double checked by the Supervisor.

Cherry picker/working platform/ crane lorry will be used, if necessary, to facilitate the removal of tree by pieces and it will be temporarily parked inside the site only. During the working at height on the trees, the workers shall wear the proper personal protective equipment including protective shoes, goggles, gloves, safety helmet with chin-strap, reflective vest, and safety harness.

The worker should wear a safety harness with the secured self-retracting lifelines (sala block system attached at the anchor point of Cherry picker Cherry picker/ working platform/ crane lorry). Anchor points must always be attached above the head.

A temporary working area will be cordoned off and alert others and against the hazards of falling objects.

The tree will be felled piece by piece using rigging/ cherry picker/ working platform which will be started from tip of branch piece by piece until all branches removed. Then the trunk shall remove from top to the bottom also piece by piece above ground level.

The tree workers will get to the crown of the slope trees by tree climbing if necessary, depending on site constraint shall also consider the risk of electrocution, especially if branches being fell off to the overhead line. This might cause serious injury to the staff and any workers nearby. The tree workers who climb the tree should be qualified tree worker. Starting the tree felling, the worker will cut the crown pieces by pieces with poles saws or chainsaws after holding the branches firmly by min.12mm rope to ground or any suitable rigging points.

In general, for branches with Diameter at breast height (DBH) between 100mm to 300mm, maximum length of each piece should be 5 m. For branches with DBH 300mm, maximum length of each piece should be 2m. However, the dimension of the cut pieces could be adjusted based on the on-site situation including target availability, slope gradient and the presence of buffers, for example, for the trees adjacent to public road, maximum size of cut piece should limit to 1.5m in length to reduce risk. For higher target availability, the cut branches will be lifted by min.12mm rope to the ground safely so that the lowering of cut limbs and stumps to avoid causing injury to person and damage to property. After the cutting of branches, the main trunk will be held firmly by the min.12mm ropes to limit its movement. Then the trunk will be cut at trunk base. Then the trunk will be laid onto the ground by the min.12mm ropes and will be cut into pieces that can be removed by the grab lorry from the site.

There might be some minor adjustment of the felling procedure in account of the on-site situation, with the same safety manner.

Tree trunks and branches shall be removed in pieces for reasons of safety and to such a manner that any potential damage to the public and adjacent railway utilities, services or pipes, structures, slopes or stream course vegetation is avoided. Care should be taken to avoid damaging such facilities.

Other existing trees to be retained adjacent to the trees to be felled shall be maintained properly, care should be taken to avoid damaging any structures or neighbouring trees, stubs, grass or surfaces.

#### 6.2.2 Sequence of Tree Felling Works (Scenario 2)

Position the mobile crane and aluminium foldable mobile tower on ground at optimum distance from tree to be felled.

Fence off the tree felling work area before operation.

Securely tie the chain saw to the man cage of aluminium foldable mobile tower or aerial working platform to avoid chain saw falling.

Tagline should be fastened to the tree branch which will be cut.

The cutting shall be started from the tallest branches to the lower branches.

Fasten and tie one end of the tree branch to be felled with min.12mm heavy-duty rope by the skilled workmen in the man cage and the other end of the min.12mm rope to be attached to the crane's b in order to control the felling down position of the tree branch.

Cut the bottom of the tree branch with the chain saw at about 1 inch depth.

The cut section of branch / truck shall be slowly brought down and directed to a safe location within the work area. The cutting length for all diameter of trunk shall be 500mm with safe working load 1 ton.

The stump shall be removed by hand grubbing and winching; stump cutting machine: hydraulic lifting or other method approved by the Engineer.

The felled tree branches and trunk shall be cut into pieces and removed offsite at the end of each working day to our nursery for mulching or compost.

### 6.3 Rigging system

Rigging system shall be used to control the falling zone of the tree branches during removing the trees located near the road or foot path.

## 7. Safety

All workers shall be equipped with reflective vests and safety helmets during operation. All workers must go through a briefing by the Construction Manager/ Engineer/ Safety Officer/Safety Supervisor before commencement of any works. A pre-meeting will be arranged before commencement of the work among Survey Team, Construction Team and Safety Team to brief the nature of works, the safety aspects and the necessary safety requirements as identified in the Risk Assessment in Appendix D.

To ensure the worker carrying out the tree felling works are fully informed of the risks and they are aware of the measures to control those risks, the Briefing will be provided before operation commence. Safety helmets fitted with chin straps must be worn within the site, safety boots, hearing protectors (if needed), high visibility jackets / sashes, reflective vests, goggles, gloves and full body harnesses for work at height will be provided to all staff working on site. Plastic barriers and reflective traffic cones will be prepared prior to work commencement to demarcate the working area. Permit-to-Dig system shall be implemented and strictly followed to mitigate the risk of damages to underground utilities. Relevant valid underground utilities plans shall be obtained and cable detection shall be conducted by competent person before commencement of works. Briefing shall be conducted to workers to acknowledge them on the underground utility conditions at the works area and precautions required. The proposed working area should be marked physically on site by CP. Any emergency situation shall be reported to site supervisors (i.e. Construction Manager/Engineer/ Foreman etc.) and Safety Department for prompt response. The emergency contact list is shown in Appendix D. The risk for the works shall be assessed and the Risk Assessment Analysis is shown in Appendix C.

## 8. Environmental

The following mitigation measures will be followed:
- General works shall be carried out during normal working hours (08:00 to 18:00). No works using PME will be carried out after 07:00pm on Sunday and public holiday without a valid construction noise permit.
- The risk of causing damage to existing trees during survey works is low. If any survey will affect the existing tree, construction team will be informed immediately for resolving.
- Excavated soil shall be stocked pile at designated area and covered properly by tarpaulin sheets to prevent dust generation and reused on site prior to disposal.
- The tree debris produced during the tree removal shall be stored in the empty area temporarily. The tree debris shall not be stored in site for more than 7 calendar days.
- ULSD Diesel will be used in all PME.
- Plant with QPME label will be employed if available.
- All chemicals will be placed on drip tray.
- Any wastewater produced during the work will be treated prior to disposal.

## 9. Quality Control

Refer to Appendix B for Inspection and Test Plan. Construction works shall be fully complied with Quality Plan. For work activity which is classified as "Quality Hold Point”, no subsequent work can be started unless the former work activity was inspected and accepted by MTR's inspectorate.
