# Predrilling works at CAs 10m away nearest track wo appendix

## 1. **Introduction**
- This document provides an overview of the method statement for predrilling of foundation works for the
area which is 10m away from the track and OHL where EDOC is not required according to the latest
BUGN2023/21 (Issue/Rev:1.0). The predrilling works will be commenced after the works areas declared as
construction areas (CAs). The method statement covers first the access to the designated works area and the
procedure related to predrilling with details of sub-contractor attached. It details the responsible personnel
including managers, engineers and workers for executing the construction activities. Furthermore, it included
the plant and equipment to be adopted and detailed set up on site. Lastly, it includes the safety and
environment and quality control requirement to ensure the construction is safe and robust. Relevant
drawings, job hazard analysis can be found in the appendix.

## 7. **Construction Methods**

### 1. **Mobilization and Setup:**
   - Mobilize drilling rig and equipment to the site.
   - Set up drilling rig at the designated drill hole location.
   - Ensure all safety measures and barriers are in place.

### 2. **Drilling Operation:**
   - Start drilling using rotary wash boring method until reaching the required depth.
   - Perform Standard Penetration Test (SPT) at specified intervals as per BD approved drawings.
   - Continue drilling until encountering rock or the specified termination depth.
   - Perform rock coring to obtain rock samples for Point Load Strength Test.

### 3. **Sample Collection and Logging:**
   - Collect soil and rock samples at specified intervals.
   - Log the samples according to the standard procedures.
   - Take photographs of the core samples for documentation.

### 4. **Backfilling:**
   - Backfill the pre-drill hole with grout of specified strength.
   - Ensure the grout is properly mixed and placed to avoid any voids.

### 5. **Instrumentation and Monitoring:**
   - Install instrumentation and monitoring devices as per the separate method statement.
   - Monitor the instrumentation readings before, during, and after the pre-drilling works.

### 6. **Daily Reporting:**
   - Prepare and submit daily record sheets containing information about the drilling operations, sample collection, and any issues encountered.
   - Ensure the daily record sheets are reviewed and approved by the RSE/RGE’s site representative.

### 7. **Completion and Documentation:**
   - Submit preliminary logs and color core photographs to the RSE/RGE’s site representative within 3 days of completing each pre-drill hole.
   - Prepare and submit the rockhead contour plan based on the ground investigation and pre-drilling results.

## 8. **Safety**

- Ensure all personnel are trained and aware of the safety procedures.
- Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times.
- Implement permit-to-work systems for excavation and lifting operations.
- Conduct regular safety briefings and toolbox talks.
- Monitor and enforce safety compliance on site.

## 9. **Environmental**

- Minimize noise and dust generation during drilling operations.
- Properly manage and dispose of drilling waste and spoil.
- Implement measures to prevent contamination of soil and water.
- Monitor environmental parameters as required by the project’s environmental management plan.

## 10. **Quality Control**

- Ensure all drilling operations are carried out as per the approved method statement and drawings.
