All control stations shall be installed rigid and secure properly and preserve by CSHK.

#### 7.1.3 Bearing and Distance Measurement

Site reconnaissance will be carried out and record the potential observation at each survey control station before the control survey to be carried out. Based on the site reconnaissance information, pre-analysis will be prepared by using of the survey software to estimate the error propagation of the control network survey or traverse survey designed.

Precise Total-station TS16A or equivalent/higher standard instrument accepted by MTR will be employed. Instrument specification is 1 second in direction and 1mm+1.5ppm in distance measurement.

An observation diagram and schedule are prepared to list out all the targets to be observed from each specific stand survey control station. The idea of the schedule is to list out as many targets as visibility permits so that all known survey control stations will be included from the observation.

Four arcs of reading on both face left and face right will be observed to all the targets as listed in observation schedule. All directions are to be read in whole circle bearing around the clock. Observation data is to be recorded into Total-station internal memory or removable memory.

Instrument height, target height and meteorological data shall be recorded. Set Zero on ppm is to be applied on the instrument during observation. Temperature and Pressure measurements are to be recorded at both ends of the line during the distance measurement for atmospheric correction on the measured distance.

The position of the set-up station which is fixed survey control station shall be checked by observing angles and distances to at least two known stations with an included angle and at least one distance measurement.

Acceptable criteria in direction measurement, Standard Deviation of the Mean, 6, of each reduced horizontal observed included angle shall not be greater than +/-3 second of arc.

Acceptable criteria in distance measurement, Standard deviation of the Mean, 6, of each reduced observed distance shall not be greater than +/-2mm. The distance must be measured by an EDM or Total-Station. Each line is measured with at least one pointing with three measures. All necessary corrections shall be applied.

### 7.1.4 Requirements

In case the Master survey control stations are found to be damaged or in error, CSHK will inform to MTR.

Prior to commencement of every levelling survey, the electronic digital level set must be tested by 2-peg test. If the collimation error exceeds the tolerance of 1mm/30m, then the instrument shall be adjusted until the collimation error falls within this tolerance.

The levelling survey shall be carried out by double run observation with at least one more benchmark for adjustment or counter checking. Levelling misclosure shall not exceed 4√k where k is total length of distance travelled km.

The levelling survey shall start from a known station and counter check with another known station.

The maximum sight distance for each levelling observation shall be 30 meters.

0.3m on both ends of invar staff shall not be used to avoid uncertainty resulting from refraction and/or bar-code reading.

The difference between sum of backsight and sum of foresight distances for each levelling route shall not exceed 2 metres and agreed on site.

### 7.2.3 Computation and Accuracy

The survey establishes the precise boundaries, the existing ground levels within the site and working areas at the time of handover, the conditions around the site and working areas and the precise location and condition of all existing features that may require reinstatement. The survey taken by the contractor and accepted with the project Manager before site clearance or excavation and with the prior acceptance of the Project manager.

A detailed initial land record survey (topographic survey) of the site shall be carried out survey is to verify and record of additional topographic surveys where there is any missing data or where the topography has changed.

To be informed the MTR's Land Surveyor before the initial survey commencement. ARISC form will also be duly submitted to the MTR's Land Surveyor to record the activity.

All the surveys data shall be recorded into the instrument internal memory or removable RAM card stored by a Total Station and to be transferred to computer for processing in a raw data format.

The survey control stations for the initial land record survey will be based on the master survey control stations and benchmarks, which provided by the MTR and those primary and secondary control stations derived from the master control stations and benchmarks. Instrument setup could be directly over known stations with backsight bearing and distance to at least one ground stations plus a bearing to any one of the ground or triangulation station.

For free stations setup, backsight with bearings and distances should be observed to at least two ground stations to provide the redundant data for checking on the setup. Instrument height and targets heights should be recorded accordingly. At least two sets of Face right and Face left readings are taken. However, free station setup is only applicable to undertake initial land record survey.

During the survey, check the bearing orientation by sighting to one of the reference points after taking about every 100 to 200 shots and at the end of observation of each set-up. The check reading shall not significantly differ from the initial reading (say by more than 1 minute). If the discrepancy exceeds 1 minute, all the survey shots observed prior to the check sight to the reference point shall be discarded. The survey instrument shall be checked, re-levelled/reset, if necessary, and the surveyed details shall be re-observed.

The initial land record survey shall cover all works areas and 50m strip outside the site boundary except otherwise being accepted. The survey shall include all existing features such as street furniture, trees, temporary structures, rail and instrumentations.

Before completion of work on each setup, check again the backsight and record it into the raw data file to make sure the data is reliable. Once the backsight bearing is out of the allowable deviation - subject to the job nature, the whole survey for this setup is to be re-surveyed again.

The Initial Land Record drawing shall be produced in MicroStation (DGN) format in accordance with the MTR CADD Drafting Specifications.

The survey report including the photocopy of all filed sheets, electronic data file and survey drawings will be submitted to MTR.

No RISC form or notification will be required if this is only a temporary work which is not relevant to the permanent work.

Random checking of the major structure shall be carried out to minimize the incautious setting out lines or level on site.

The survey control station will be similar to those mentioned in the initial land record survey.

Distance between instrument and setting out point shall normally not exceed 50m in general for the major setting out point/line/level.

Observe and check the bearing orientation by sighting to one of the reference points at the start of set up for setting out. Check the bearing orientation after setting out every 20 to 30 points or less and at the end of the setup of setting out to check the stability of the instrument. If the check bearing significantly differs from the initial observed bearing (more than 30 seconds), re-setting out or re-survey check shall be conducted.

For free stations setup, backsight with bearings and distances should be observed to at least two ground stations to provide the redundant data for checking on the setup.

The survey result shall be submitted in accordance with the request as accepted with MTR's land Surveyor, e.g., Sketch or sketch showing the nature of setting out marks, survey results comparing coordinates/level of the setting out marks, etc.
