4. Each group will be CP(T), WPIC, 3 to 4 nos of workers.
5. Physical barriers (water-filled barriers without panel) will be used for demarcating the works area to ensure CSHK workers will not be able to go from the work site on/near the test track into the mainline area (Permissions from MTR OCC TC are required via DCC prior to the commencement of the work on/near the test track).

### Transportation Arrangement
For standpipe, piezometer located in the operations area (OAs) between test track and mainline, drilling rigs are required. There are a few delivery methods as follows:

#### Lifting Operation at South Road (Method 1)
50 Ton mobile crane would be adopted to transplant the drilling rig to the work area. The actual size may vary slightly to suit the available arranged plant. Also, the lifting operation will be submitted to MTR for approval before starting. The lifting operation included ground condition checking, lifting plan with calculation. The typical lifting plan, section plan, and calculation are as follows:

- The 50 Ton mobile crane will set up at the South Road at Night Time. The ground conditions shall be checked by ICE for the 50 Ton mobile crane lifting operation and submit to MTR.
- Lifting Weight Calculation, check the lifting object weight included LAGA weights, ensure the weight not more than 80% Capacity of Mobile Crane.

**Calculation:**
- Drilling rig weight = 1.4 tons
- Crane lorry lifting capacity = 13.4 tons @ 14.6m
- 80% of Capacity = 10.72 tons

#### Contingency Plan
Emergency team and a spare lifting crane will be on standby in the event of lifting crane failure or breakdown.

#### Rigging Point of Drilling Rig
- Except for the drilling rig, the water tank (empty) and casing (maximum 6m length) with hanger would be delivered to the works area by mobile crane. The valid LALG certificates would be provided.

#### Limitation of the Mobile Crane
- Inclined Angle
- Boom Length
- Swing Angle
- Loading Radius

#### Drilling Rig Installation
- Procedure for Raising of Rig Mast
  - Once the drill is in place, the operator will perform the inspection with the checklist "Drill Weekly Checklist."
  - The hydraulic mast cylinder must be completely depressurized, confirmed by the position of the mast raise/lower lever and visual inspection by the operator. The two backstay legs should be fixed in the designed position of the drilling rig.
  - Others standing near the drilling rig during mast raising operation should not be allowed. The operator raises the mast slowly by increasing the pressure of the mast hydraulic cylinder and monitors two backstay legs remain fixed in the right position.
  - Once the mast is in the designed position, the operator should hold the pressure of the mast hydraulic cylinder to secure and lock the mast in place and instruct the assistant to insert the safety pin to lock the position of the mast. Then, tighten the two backstay leg bolts. After the operator checks and confirms the mast position, he will release the mast hydraulic lifting cylinder pressure and the mast lifting procedure is basically completed.
  - Drilling works may proceed after general condition checking.

- Procedure for Lowering of Rig Mast
  - The operator should hold the mast in position by increasing the pressure of the hydraulic cylinder slowly so that there is no tension on the mast backstay legs. The operator shall then instruct the assistant to loosen the bolts of the two mast backstay legs.
  - Remove the safety pin after the bolts of the mast backstay legs.
  - The monitoring mast legs should be placed at the designed position. After visual inspection by the operator, the rig mast can resume mast lowering operations until it is in a horizontal position.

#### Lifting Method for the Loose Materials
- Double tagline attached at the lifting objects before lifting.
- For rigging stabilization, the tiedown straps will be used to tie the drill casings with hanger together; connect the hook with anchoring point is secured (the anchoring point must be structurally sound tested and examined by a competent examiner).
- Prevent slipping or displacement of any loose objects or loads during lifting. Double wrap choker hitch method will be adopted.
- Track trolleys are to be used for the transportation of dismantled drilling rig parts near the existing building AB23. The transportation and set-up of the drill rig are as follows:
  - One bay of wire mesh fence will be fenced off by a water barrier near AB23 and then temporarily removed to form the temporary access to Test Track.
  - The track trolleys will then be loaded on Test Track.
  - The parts of the drilling rig will be loaded on the track trolleys and transported to the required location between Test Track and mainline.
  - The wire mesh will be reinstalled after the transportation of parts each day.
  - The drilling rig will be assembled on site and certified by RPE. After that, the drilling rig is ready to work.
  - The temporary access and routing of track trolley refer to Appendix Track Trolley.

#### Manual Handling (Method 3)
- For easy manual handling, the drilling rig will be dismantled into small parts (drilling rigs, water tank (empty), and casing with hanger), and materials/ casing will be divided into small sizes. The small parts of the drilling rig will be transported to the bifurcation area via the existing gate no. 4 & 5. The drilling rig will be assembled on site and certified by RPE. After that, the drilling rig is ready to work.
- The largest part weight of the drilling rigs should be ~200kg, and min. 6 nos. of workers to carry.
