The lifting procedure will be suspended when there is a train passing through the existing TUFWL trackwork. Our WPIC will inform the plant operator once MTR informs our site supervision staff or WPIC.

All lifting works with crawler crane will be placed on the location which is at least around 25 meters away from the OHL post under the supervision of CP(T) or WPIC on site, so as to minimise the effect on OHL Post or consequence of any accident of lifting works. The detailed lifting plan is attached in Appendix D.

Installation of Sheet Piles (Referring to Method Statement for Installation of Sheet Piles for the Temporary Underfloor Wheel Lathe (ACC Reference No.1701/W/000/CSC/760/000155).

Construction Works of Excavation and Lateral Support (ELS) for Temporary Underfloor Wheel Lathe

Step 1. After completion of the sheet pile, installation of the first layer of the wailing bracket by welding method at +6.850mPD.

Figure 7.9.1: Typical waling and bracket details

The weight of the brackets is approximately 11kg each, which requires a crawler crane to lift and hold the walings in the position for welding.

The weight of the walings is approximately 0.9 tonnage each, which requires a crawler crane to lift and hold the walings in the position for welding. There will be a splice joint for the connection of steel members if the length of the waling is longer than 12 meters. If any waling cannot be installed properly, additional concrete will be poured to fill the gap between the sheet pile and the railing.

The weight of the struts is approximately 0.9 tonnage each, which requires a crawler crane to lift and hold the walings in the position for welding. There will have splice joint for the connection of steel members if the length of the waling is longer than 12 meters.

All the lifting works will be supervised under lifting supervisors, and the materials shall be placed in a safe condition before the commencement of welding works.

Figure 7.9.2: Installation of first layer waling and struts

Step 2. Once the Temporary Works Coordinator has issued the Permit to Load, further excavation works can be carried out. A 3-tonnage excavator will be lifted by a crawler crane to the Excavation and Lateral Support area. Another excavator will be used to remove the soil from the Excavation and Lateral Support area to the dump trucks in ground level. For the soil from excavation works, it will be removed to disposal works out of the site immediately without any stockpiling works. If we need any temporary stockpile, a temporary stockpile location within the Construction Area is provided.

Excavate to 500mm below for the second shoring layer, which is around +2.700mPD. If required, excavation works shall be inspected by a CP once a week and the CP shall complete the statutory form (Form 4).

A 3” submersible pump will be provided for the dewatering purpose. If the dewatering process is slow, an additional submersible pump or larger submersible pumps will be provided.

A temporary access staircase or temporary access tower will be provided and the exact location shall be determined on site. The access will be relocated from time to time subject to the site works.

Step 3. Install the second shoring layer at +3.200mPD

Figure 7.9.4: Typical waling and bracket details

The weight of the brackets is approximately 11kg, and the workers will hold the brackets in the position for welding.

The weight of the walings are approximately 1.6 tonnage each, which requires crawler crane to lift and hold the walings in the position for welding. There will be splice joint for the connection of steel members if the length of the waling is longer than 12 meters. If any waling cannot be installed properly, additional concrete will be poured to fill the gap between the sheet pile and the railing.

The weight of the struts are approximately 1.9 tonnage each, which requires crawler crane to lift and hold the walings in the position for welding. There will have splice joint for the connection of steel members if the length of the waling is longer than 12 meters.

All the lifting works will be supervised under lifting supervisors, and the materials shall be placed in a safe condition before the commencement of welding works.

Figure 7.9.5: Installation of second layer waling and shoring

Step 4. Once the Temporary Works Coordinator has issued the Permit to Load, further excavation works can be carried out.

Excavate to the final excavation level to +1.645mPD and -0.32mPD carefully as per the latest ELS drawing. If required, excavation works shall be inspected by a CP once a week and the CP shall complete the statutory form (Form 4). The excavation works shall take only to its required level and do not have extra excavation to affect the existing ground condition.

A 3” submersible pump will be provided for the dewatering purpose. If the dewatering process is slow, an additional submersible pump or larger submersible pumps will be provided.

Step 5. Construct a 75mm thick blinding layer. with the use of a crane lorry, to deliver the concrete from ground level to the blinding layer.

Safety (Risk Assessments)

1 For workers on site within 10m zone adjacent to the OHL post or trackwork, those workers shall obtain RSI before works, and supervised by CP(T).
2 All workers shall attend a site-specific induction course conducted by the Safety Department. The Safety Officer shall explain the necessary safety requirements and the Site Agent/Foreman/ Engineer in charge of the work shall explain the system of work to his supervisors and workers.
3 All workers shall be equipped with reflective vests and safety helmets during operation. All workers must go through a briefing by the Site Agent/ Safety Officer/ Safety Supervisor before commencement of any works. All workers on site shall obtain an approved "Mandatory Basic Safety Training Certificate".
4 A pre-meeting will be arranged before commencement of the work among Foreman/Site Agent, MTR’s representatives and Safety Department to brief the nature of works, the safety aspects and the requirements laid down in the Safety Plan. Besides, Temporary Works Management Plan, Hot Work Permit and Permit to Load will be introduced and implemented in this construction works.
5 Safety helmets fitted with chin straps must be worn within the site, safety boots, hearing protectors (if needed), high visibility jackets/ sashes, reflective vests, goggles, gloves and full body harnesses for work at height will be provided to all staff working on site. Warning signs and barriers will be erected where necessary.
6 Any emergency situation shall be reported to CSHK’s site supervisors (i.e. Site Agent/ Foreman/ Engineer, etc.) and Safety Department for prompt response. The emergency contact list is shown in Appendix C.
The risk for the works shall be assessed and the Risk Assessment Analysis is shown in Appendix A.
