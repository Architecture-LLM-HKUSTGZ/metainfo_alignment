Traffic and Security Management
Work Area W11
Contractor Vehicle Arrangement: Pre-registration of the car plate and driver information will be provided to the Security Operation Centre (SOC) to obtain the entry permit through the west gate. Contractor Vehicle should display the entry permit, a label with the wordings '1701 contractor vehicle' and location plan, and the destination on the windscreen. CSHK will report the total number of workers In/Out Records to SOC Daily. Registered vehicles shall not carry unauthorized/unregistered passengers. Before entering the west gate, CSHK, CP(T) will measure the height of vehicle, ensure the height is within 4m. After entering the west gate, the Contractor Vehicle will be accompanied by the escort vehicle with CP(T). No vehicle over 4m high and below 4.5m high is allowed unless a Permit-to-Move is issued by CWBU to DCC for approval. Vehicle height measurements/checks shall be conducted by CP(T)s before entering depot areas and passing thru the west level crossing. When accessing west level crossing, escort car of CPT shall communicate with DCC in order to get permission to drive across the level crossing. CPT shall inform DYM when vehicles passing through the yellow line underneath the height restriction gauge, and within the double white zone No vehicle Reversing is allowed. Permitted vehicles must be driven through level crossings at a speed of not over 10kph. All vehicles, except shuttle bus for staff and workers, shall not be entered from West gate from 7:30am to 8:30am in order to minimize the track jam. For details of traffic and security management plan shall refer to separate submission. All security guard shall have RSI training.

Worker Verification: All workers will be picked up at designated area such as Tung Chung Station. During boarding the shuttle bus, hand-held facial recognition will be performed to verify the worker's qualification. The facial recognition system will check if the person has passed the RSI and possesses a green card. List of workers shall be submitted for MTR for registration before starting of works, the list shall be updated weekly and available for MTR as requested.

Uniform and Safety Equipment: All workers shall wear PPE and the standard uniform and safety helmet for easy recognition by security guards and YM.

Construction Methods / Construction Sequence Drawings
Preparation: All works before commencement must contact depot YM to get approval first. Identify the existing MTR facilities at or within construction site, such as manhole cover, OHL portal. Carry out the condition survey and photographic record to locate the UU before any excavation works. Permit to dig system will be implemented to ensure protection system to the existing UU before commencement of works. The method statement will be submitted separately. If condition survey found MTR existing equipment/material, we will fence off the existing MTR stuff first and have protection. After condition survey, we will give the results to depot and liaise about the existing MTR stuff. All workers should possess the qualification Railway Safety training (RSI), and can only smoke at the smoking area that demarcated by CSHK. Prior to commence the works, CSHK will provide the information to MTR CWBU Inspector, in order to submit the work notice to SOC/DCC every Friday.

For Crane Lorry and Lifting Gear: All plants and equipment will be inspected prior to the mobilization on site to ensure that they are in good working condition and comply with the current regulations, all statutory forms/certificates of Lifting Appliances (LA) and Lifting Gear (LG) must be valid. If they are in good working condition, CSHK will arrange the plants mobilization to site. Before operation of the plant, CSHK will arrange a plant inspection with MTR CWBU inspector. If they are in good working condition, CSHK will submit the permit to lift (for crane lorry, grab lorry lifting gear) and plant permit (for backhoe). The Safe Working Load (SWL) is required to be shown on lifting appliance or to lifting gear. All lifting work is to be in accordance with the F&IU (lifting appliance and lifting gear regulations).

Lunch Arrangement for CSHK workers: If the number of workers is less than 10 people, workers can have their lunch at depot canteen after 12:30 pm. If the number of workers is more than 10 people, workers will go out of the site for lunch or arrange meal boxes for them.

The sequence for site clearance at W11 is shown in the following table:

Step 1: Fence off the site clearance area / crane operation area by plastic barrier. Deploy grab lorry or 13ton/20ton backhoe(s) to remove weeds and garbage. The backhoe will be transported on site by trailer. Weeds shall be removed away from Depot asap as it will catch fire easily. Firefighting equipment must be provided.

Step 2: To remove the garbage, CSHK will provide the information for MTR CWBU inspector to fill in the material transfer record sheet to the SOC. CSHK will arrange the grab lorry to transport the garbage to the waste disposal.

Step 3: The existing UU within the proposed working area will be detected and recorded in the layout plan prior to works commencement. Existing drainage manhole cover will also be opened to inspect the condition. Please refer to the method statement of General Underground Utility Survey for Construction Area (CA) for details.

If there are other utilities/services found on site but not shown in the available drawing, a further investigation and confirmation with MTR is required. The 

Step 4: Submit the UU detection report and railway facility & manhole drainage report to MTR. The limitation will be clearly stated in the UU detection report, e.g., survey unreliable or survey not successful with appropriate safety protective measures. Ground Penetration Radar shall be considered in a high-risk area advised by CP.

Step 5: Utilizing plastic barriers will be provided to protect existing UU covers and enhance protection.

Step 6: Site inspection with MTR / HKTS representative will be carried out to identify whether if these covers and other existing facilities, e.g., existing pole, to be retained or not. The summary of remove/retain facilities will be submitted separately.

Step 7: Site inspection will be carried out with MTR and HKTS representative to identify which material to be relocated/removed.

After inspection, the material will be relocated to the designated area or to be removed according to the instruction of MTR / HKTS representative. The summary of remove/relocate material list will be submitted separately. Crane lorry will be deployed for relocation of material. To remove the abundant material, CSHK will provide the information for MTR CWBU inspector to fill in the material transfer record sheet to the SOC.

Step 8: After the completion of step 3 to 8, Permit to dig will be issued. Safety briefing will be conducted by CP before the existing the hard paving/abandon covers and facilities removal works. The excavation/hard pave removal works will be limited to 300mm depth from the ground. Excavators will be deployed to remove the hard paving and abandon facilities.

Safety (Risk Assessments): Lifting zone must be fenced off by fencing before lifting. All personnel cannot stay in the lifting zone until the lifting item is placed on the ground. Outrigger of the crane lorry must be fully extended. Appropriate dimension of parts must be used. The ground stability must be checked before lifting. Risk Assessment attached in Appendix A has been prepared for all general activities. Specific safety procedures and precautions have been developed for all site operatives to follow. The Construction Team Leader together with the RSO, will supervise the implementation and make an adjustment according to the actual site operations, in order to maintain a safe and amicable working environment.
